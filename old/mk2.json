        "text": "If you're not feeling close to the Guru, it's because of you. Because of your mind, because of your ego concepts. Share with the Guru that which is very important or intimate to you. Share that. Do not feel shame, shy, or judgmental about yourself.\nUnless you express to the Master that which is very intimate and important to you, just being on the formal and informal communication levels cannot make you feel close. \"How are you, where are you going? How have you been?\" Stop formal and superficial conversations with the Master and speak with your heart that which is very important and intimate, very deep to your life. Don't just say how much the squash costs, 30 cents or whatever.\nIf you don't feel close to the Master, there's no point in having a Master. It is just another burden to you. You have enough already. Just say \"Goodbye,\" get rid of it.\nQuestion: When you play little games and push us away, how can we feel close to you?\nAnswer: You should feel more close if you are pushed away, scolded or ignored. Because to ignore somebody takes a lot of effort. When a Master does not even ignore wrapping paper, or a flower that is in a vase, how can he ignore a walking, talking, breathing human being who is connected? How could that be ignored? So when you understand this, you already feel close.\nQuestion: Can we call you every week?\nResponse from the room: Call Guruji every week and if he doesn't answer the phone then you know you are loved.\nAnswer: Yes, put that in. \t(Laughter)\nYou are with the Master to share the joy of the Master, to share the consciousness of the Master. For that, you have to empty your cup of what is already in it. So you share that with the Master. You share whatever you have and don't judge, \"Oh, that is garbage.\" The Master is ready to accept any garbage of any extent. However you are, he will embrace you. He is ready to share. You only have to share from your side.",

Don't repeat anything that someone tells you or opinions about anyone that someone states -- \"That so-and-so said such-and-such about you.\" If someone comes to tell you such things, discourage them. Don't believe it.\nIf someone blames you directly, know that they are taking away your bad karma and let it go. Don't believe in it, and if you're one of the Guru's close ones, you will take all of the blame of the world with a smile.\nConflict is the nature of the world; comfort is the nature of the self. Amidst the conflict seek the comfort.\nWhen you are bored with the comfort, get into the games of the world. When you are tired of the games of the world, get into the comforts of the Self. If you are one of the Guru's close ones, you do both simultaneously. Trying to end conflict prolongs it. Face the conflict by seeking the comfort of the Self.\nGod is alive in the world and has been putting up with all the ongoing conflicts throughout the ages. If God can put up with all the conflicts, you can too. The moment you agree to be with the conflict, the conflict disappears.\nPeople who love peace do not want to fight, and those who fight do not love peace. Those who want peace want to run away. What is needed here is to be peaceful within and then fight. The whole message of the Gita is to be peaceful yourself and then fight. Krishna tells Arjuna to fight but be in peace at the same time. Does this ring a bell?\nIn the world, you resolve one conflict and another one comes up. For example, Russia is solved and then Bosnia arises. You make one better, and then another starts up. Your body gets a cold, then you get better; then your back hurts, then it gets better. Your body gets better, and then the mind goes. The world runs like this, isn't it?\nWithout any intention, misunderstandings happen. It's not up to you to try to resolve them. Ignore them and be alive.",

        "text": "Master is a doorway. And the doorway needs to be more charming than the world so that you will come to the doorway. Someone is in the street and there is rain, thunder, hot sun; they need shelter. They look around, they find a doorway. They come to the doorway. The doorway is more inviting, more charming, more celebrative, more joyful than anything else in the world.\nNothing could give that much peace, joy, pleasure in the world. Once you come to the doorway, you enter the door and see the world from there. See the world from the eyes of the Master. This is a sign that you have come to the Master. Otherwise you may still be standing in the street and looking at the door.\nBut once you have entered the door, then you will see the whole world from the eyes of the Master. This means what? In every situation that you face, you will think, \"If this situation comes in front of the Master, how would he handle it?\" or \"How would she handle it?\" \"If this complication comes in front of the Master, how would he take it?\" \"If someone blames the Master like this, how would he handle it?\" See the world from the eyes of the Master all the time.\nThe world looks much more beautiful; not a nasty place. But a place filled with love, filled with joy, cooperation, compassion, and all virtues. The world is much more fun. Looking through the doorway, there is no fear. You will look at the world without any fear. You will be in all relationships with everybody without any fear. Because there is shelter.\nFrom inside home, you will look at the thunder, you will look at the storm, you will look at the rain, you will look at the bright sun. Inside you have air conditioning. Very cool, pleasant. Outside it's hot. You donÒ´ mind because there is nothing that can really distract you, disturb you, or take the fullness away from you. Such a sense of security, such a sense of fullness and joy comes. That is the purpose of having a Master.\nAll relationships in the world go topsy-turvy. You make relationships and you break relationships. All relationships can get broken or made up and again broken. And there is craving and aversion. This is the world. This is samsara.\nBut the Master is not a relationship. The Master is the Presence. What is necessary is to feel the Presence of the Master, not to make a relationship. Don't make the Master a part of your world. Then the same, \"Oh, he looked at me.\" \"He didn't look at me.\" \"Oh, he said this.\" \"He didn't say that.\" \"Oh, somebody is close. I am not close.\" All this garbage comes into it. You feel the Presence of the Master, that is eternal. That has been there with you before, now, and will be there in the future, too.\nMaster is the Presence. World is relativity. And relativity has limitations. Presence is unlimited. Presence is vast, infinite, and all comprehensive, all inclusive. And the presence of the Master in one's life will bring fulfillment to all relations. Every relationship will become complete with the presence of the Infinity if the Master is in your life.",

You are not in the gray area.\nSee, the eyes are dark, eyebrows are dark, the thymus -- the most powerful organ of the body -- is black. Hemoglobin -- the main force of the body -- is black. You cannot survive without black. It is part of you.\nOr see it as white. Eye is also white. Bones are white; the structure on which the whole body stands is white. Put it in a category of black -- no problem -- accept. Put it in a category of white -- no problem -- doubt is not there. Have conviction. \"I accept. They are dishonest and still part of me.\" That's it. Finished.\nDoubt is wanting to get rid of something. Doubt is a temporary state. Neither up nor below. There tension arises.",

One fire, like a ghee lamp, lights your way and purifies. Another fire made of toxic material creates pollution.\nYou are also like fire. Are you the fire that creates smoke and pollution or the flame of camphor which creates light and fragrance? A saint is like a camphor flame that creates light and the fragrance of love. He is the friend of life.\nThe fire that creates light and warmth and is useful is of higher quality. The fire that creates light and a little smoke as well is of medium quality. The fire that creates darkness and only smoke is of low quality. Learn to distinguish the different fires. If your senses are engaged in goodness, then you will create light and fragrance. If engaged in impurity, you create smoke and darkness. It issamyamathat transforms the quality of fire in you. Next week we will discusssamyama.",

        "title": "HABITS AND VOWS",
        "text": "How to get rid ofvasanas(impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits.\nYou want to get rid of habits because they give pain and restrict you. The nature ofvasanais to bother you, or bind you, and wanting to be free is the nature of life. Life wants to be free and when a soul doesn't know how to be free, it wanders through lifetimes wanting freedom.\nThe way to come out of habits is vows. This issamyama. Everybody is endowed with a littlesamyama.\nA vow should be time bound. This would bring good conduct and save you from being wayward. Consider the time and place for vows to be taken.\nWhen the mind dwells on useless thoughts, then two things happen. One is that all those old patterns come up and you feel discouraged by them. You blame yourself and feel that you have not made any progress.\nThe second thing is that you see it as an opportunity forsamyamaand feel happy about it. Withoutsamyama,life will not be happy and diseases arise. For example, you know you should not eat three servings of ice cream, or eat ice cream every day, or otherwise you will get sick.\nHabits will clog you when there is no liveliness or juice in life. When there is a direction for life force, you can rise above habits throughsamyama.\nTake vows according to time and place. For example, suppose someone has a habit of smoking cigarettes and says, \"I will quit smoking,\" but cannot do it. They can take a vow, three months or 90 days; a time-bound vow. If someone is used to cursing and swearing, take a vow not to use bad language for ten days. Don't take it for a lifetime; you will break it immediately. If you happen to break it in between, don't worry. Just begin again. Slowly increase the duration until it becomes your nature.\nAll those habits which bother you, bind them in vows, insamyama. So all those who are in Satsang, take a time-bound vow today and make a note of it. If you break a vow, make a note of it and share the time and date at the next Satsang. Continue it again. Tie those habits which bring you pain insamyama.",

        "text": "When someone blames you, what do you usually do? Blame them back or you put up resistance in yourself. When someone blames you, they actually take away some negative karma from you. If you understand this and don't put up resistance and feel happy about it, then you drop your resistance. \"Oh, good. That person is blaming me. Good. Something is going away.\" And when you drop the resistance, your karma goes away. Do you see what I'm saying?\nSo when someone blames you and you put up resistance in your mind, and you don't react, then you are not allowing them to take the negative karma. Outside you may resist, but inside if you don't resist, and feel happy, \"Oh, good, somebody is there to blame me and take some negative karma,\" you will feel immediately lighter.\nHow does it feel to you when someone blames you? Do you feel some heaviness? Usually, when someone blames you, you feel hurt and you feel unhappy, you feel sad. This is all because you're . . . resisting. That is it. What you resist, persists. The ignorant person tells someone, \"Don't blame me because it hurts me.\"\nAn enlightened person also says \"Don't blame me.\" Do you know why? Because it might hurt you. This is a beautiful point. What are the points? You get hurt because you resist the blame. When someone blames you, you resist it inside. Outside you may not resist, but inside when you resist, then that hurts you.\nAn ignorant person warns you, \"You better not hurt me, you better not blame me because I will feel hurt.\" Someone warns you not to blame them because it will hurt them and they'll do something harmful to you out of revenge.\nAn enlightened person says \"Don't blame me because it will hurt you.\" So here you say, don't blame because of compassion. You can tell someone, don't blame me out of compassion, or you can say it out of anger.",

Krishna is the formless center which is everywhere. Any attraction from anywhere is coming only from Krishna. Often people fail to see the spirit behind the attraction and merely hold on to the outer shell. And the moment you try to possess the shell, you will see Krishna has played a trick and you will be left with an empty shell in your hands and tears in your eyes.\nBe clever like Radha -- don't be tricked by Krishna. Krishna could not escape from Radha, for her whole world was filled with Krishna. If you can see that wherever there is an attraction, there is Krishna; then you are Radha, you are in your center.\nThe mind moves towards beauty, joy and truth. Krishna tells Arjuna, \"I am the beauty in the Beautiful, the strength in the Strong, the wisdom in the Wise.\" In this way he arrests the mind from moving away from him.\nKrishna reveals this Knowledge to Arjuna because he isAnasuya.

If a mirror is dusty, you need a duster to clean it. But if your eyes have a cataract, any amount of dusting will not help. So first you have to remove the cataract. Then you can see that the mirror is already clean.\nThere is a certain mind set that always finds fault, even in the best conditions in the world. When you give a person with this mind set the best, they still find faults. Even with the best possible companion, or the most beautiful painting, they will still find something wrong. That kind of mind set cannot know the sacred Knowledge. Krishna tells Arjuna that he is giving him the Royal Secret, because he isanasuya. \"You are not finding fault in Me, even though you are so close.\"\nFrom a distance, even craters cannot be seen. Even on a smooth surface there will be holes. If you are only interested in the holes, you will not see the magnanimity of things. If you are not inanasuya, Knowledge cannot blossom in you. Then there is no point in giving Knowledge.\nQuestion: What about discrimination -- Wisdom?\nAnswer: If it is in your vision, your vision will find discrimination. The moment you are out of the path, everything is all wrong, that is notanasuya. For example, you have a friendship, and after 10 years you decide to leave. When you leave, you do not see the good in that relationship. You find fault. This is notanasuya.\nHowever, once you discover you have the wrong vision, half of the wrong vision has already disappeared. There is a fine line here. There cannot be any better example than the cataract. Instead of saying, \"My vision is blurred,\" you say, \"The whole world is not sharp.\" Suppose someone is coming in. It is windy, so you shut the door. But the person thinks the door has been slammed in his face! This isasuya. It is notanasuya. Most of the population is like this.\nAsuyais finding fault. It is seeing malicious intent everywhere. It is like a child who says, \"Mother, you don't love me!\" The child's vision is wrong. If the mother does not love the child, who will? It is the same as if someone comes and says, \"Guruji, you don't love me!\" If I don't love them, forget about it. Nobody else in the world will! Where else will they find love? Nowhere. A mother may get frustrated but not a Master.\nQuestion: It seems as though you can't haveanasuyaunless you are enlightened?\nAnswer: Not always. This is an excuse. To get enlightenment, you must have this vision.",

        "text": "The love of the ignorant can be harmful yet even the anger of the Enlightened is not harmful. It can be only good!\nAn example is the school at the Art of Living Ashram in Bangalore. 250 children are enrolled but only 200 come to class on any given day. Fifty children don't show up. Why? They cry at home, \"Mother, I don't want to go to school.\"\nThe mother says, \"Oh, la la, don't cry . . . ok.\" She thinks, \"No child in the world is like my child.\" And so she sticks up for the child and begins to speak for him. She does not see the teacher's point of view. The mother asks the teacher, \"Why are you not teaching my child properly? He is so innocent, so lovely.\" So, what happens -- the child grows up spoiled. The love in the mother's ignorance has spoiled the child. The child will never learn the alphabet, never learn to read or write, but the mother says, \"Oh, never mind, there are sheep to look after and fields to tend.\" The mother's love in ignorance has spoiled the child.\nThe anger of the Enlightened is a blessing. There are many instances of this in thePuranas. Once a Master was traveling in the middle province of India with a disciple following him a few yards behind. Some boys who were rude, rough, and abusive began to throw stones and tease the disciple calling him names. This went on for some time as the boys followed the Master and the disciple. They came to a river. The Master and the disciple got into a boat in order to cross. The boys got in another boat which started to sink in the middle of the river.\nThe Master slapped the disciple across the face. The disciple was so surprised as he had not said a word back to the boys in response to their taunts. He had been such a good disciple and yet the Master had slapped him!\nThe Master said, \"It is your fault. You are responsible for their boat sinking. You did not respond to their abuse. Nature has now punished them in a worse way because you did not have enough compassion to quell their insults.\"\nThe slap that the Master gave took away the karma of this event such that it would not be carried into the future of the boys. It also served to take away any little bit of joy the disciple may have felt at seeing the boys' boat sink! Thus, it also took away the karma of the event for the disciple. So, the anger of the Enlightened is a blessing!",

No, they are totally bound, not even allowed to put the right foot down when told the left foot. Their steps are measured and they are unable even to walk with a natural rhythm. There is total lack of freedom in defense. That which has absolutely no freedom is protecting the freedom of the country! So it is with the police; they protect the freedom of the individual. But are they free?\nDiscipline protects freedom. They both go hand in hand. Understand this and go ahead in life. You have some restrictions and it is this that allows you freedom. You can choose to focus either on freedom or discipline, and this makes you happy or unhappy. Freedom without discipline is like a country without a defense.\nFences should be fences; a fence cannot be built all over the property. If your fence is all over, how can you build on the property? That state of high absolute freedom is too difficult; we need to be very practical. Yes, there is a state of unlimited bliss, the freedom Advaita talks about. The Advaita Knowledge has been totally misused or used according to one's own fancies and conveniences.\nThere must be awareness in the mind, love in the heart, and righteousness in action.\nLove and fear are two possibilities that put you on track. The Jewish religion put fear as the main thing so that life could improve. Nature induces fear at a certain age in a child. When a child is very young, it gets 100 percent time and love of the mother. The child has no fear. As the child grows more independent it becomes cautious. Nature brings in an iota of fear. With freedom, the child starts walking carefully. Fear of losing freedom also brings defense. The purpose of defense is to eliminate fear.",

As one understands the paradigm shift, scepticism is removed.\nA real scientist can never afford to be a sceptic because scepticism closes down possibilities and does not continue to probe into unknown areas of existence.\nIn short, scepticism is an \"I know it all\" attitude, and this attitude is unscientific. Scepticism is dispelled by Knowledge. Perception and inference are two means of knowing.\nIn every human being deep inside, there is faith and love. What you think is scepticism is only a thin layer. If you hold in your mind that they are sceptics you empower their scepticism.\nDo not recognize someone's scepticism and try to argue with them. Argument strengthens their scepticism. Fear of interference in one's freedom brings more resistance and causes scepticism.\nYour silence and the smile from your heart will dispel their scepticism. There is nothing better than silence to break scepticism. Silence means the quality of consciousness, not just keeping lips tight.\nScepticism doesn't come up in children. It comes only with people who walk with boundaries. Children have no scepticism. They live in their fantasy world, a world of many possibilities.

They are impure because they have moved away from the self. After 10 days of just being with that experience and reading the Gita, being with the Knowledge and pulling themselves back into the Self, then it is calledShaucha.

Go deeper in to yourself, then realShauchahappens.\nShaucha'sbenefits are clarity in the intellect, a pleasing mind, focused awareness in the mind, a say over the senses, and therefore eligibility to realize the Self.\nShauchais disinterestedness in the tendencies of one's own senses and non-association with other people. If a tendency in your body arises just have the understanding, \"Oh yes, here is this old familiar tendency coming up again. Come on, you have had this experience enough, and still the body is craving for it again.\" Disinterestedness in one's own body -- just an idea, a sort of distaste, and in one moment it changes.\nWhy do people love each other so much, have such an intimate relationship, and then fight?Ashauchahas happened.

Suppose you get drowned in any worldly aspect, just know this isAshaucha. . . \"That is why I am suffering misery.\" Then come back toShaucha.\nYour attraction or craving is only as long as you think someone is \"other.\" When you think they are part of you or your Self, then the attraction dies out. That is why a husband or wife is not attracted to the partner but to someone else because the partner has already become a part of them.\nWhen you realize everyone is part of your Self, you enjoy the whole world without a sense of craving.",

Most people have a small imagination and are stuck with that, and that causes frustration. But if you are a devotee, you say \"Let Thy Will be done\" and then you will step lightly to the goal. You will take it easy. We have to make a distinction. Some people say \"Let God do everything and surrender\" and others say \"I have to be responsible.\"\nSurrender is saying \"Let Thy Will be done\" and \"Thy Will\" for you is to take responsibility for the whole world.\nIt appears to be opposing and conflicting in nature -- in fact they are two sides of the same coin. The more you surrender, the more responsive you become. One who is irresponsible cannot surrender either. Why is someone irresponsible? They are lazy or fearful or both. If you are lazy or fearful, you cannot be in love.\nTotal responsibility is total surrender. It's a little hard to chew, but this is the truth. People usually say either I take responsibility or surrender, but I tell you they go hand in hand. Suppose you are surrendered to the Knowledge. That means you are committed to sharing it with others. You take responsibility to see that it flourishes.\nQuestion: The confusion comes with the doership?\nAnswer: When you are taking responsibility and you find blocks, remember \"surrender.\" That gives you strength to move ahead. It releases you from the weight of the doership. Responsibility is the dynamic expression of life in the present moment. When you are shaken, remember the basis of responsibility as surrender.\nTaking responsibility or surrendering without doership is the skill of the wise. Total irresponsibility is impossible for you. Limited responsibility makes you weak. A little water in the sun will evaporate but the ocean never dries up. Limited responsibility tires you out.

        "text": "PADMANABHA -- THE LOTUS NAVEL\nDifferent organs of our body are governed by different devas. The solar plexus is connected with the sun, that's why it is called \"solar\" plexus. When the first rays of the sun fall on the solar plexus, it is very good for your body. DoingSurya Namaskar(\"sun salutation\") yoga asana in the early morning is very good. The solar plexus has a profound impact on the central nervous system, optic nerves, stomach, and what we usually call \"gut feeling.\" It is the second brain in your body. Usually the solar plexus is slightly bigger than an almond. Studies have shown that with the practice of yoga, meditation, and Sudarshan Kriya, the solar plexus can become as a large as the size of the palm. Then it performs better. It balances the body functions. When the solar plexus expands, the intuitive mind works better. The mind becomes clear and focussed. When the solar plexus contracts, one feels horrible, sad, depressed, and all the negative feelings come.\nKrishna was called Padmanabha, meaning \"whose navel is the size of a lotus flower.\" If you become Padmanabha, you become absolutely creative. Brahma, the Creator, is born out of a blossomed solar plexus.\nThese days, the solar plexus remains small, but the tummy keeps getting bigger.",

Children take each object they play with and make it totally personal. Even a stone has a face; even the sun laughs. When you attach emotion, the whole creation becomes personal.  When you remove the emotion, even people become objects. Violence is removing the emotion.  How a person can kill another person: it is when they do not see them as a person, they see them as an object. But even a stone attracts reverence when it becomes personal.\nDean says: In military training they teach soldiers to see people as killing objects coming toward you that need to be killed first.\nSusannah says: In the temple even a stone is elevated to the level of spirit.\nThe impersonal cannot attract reverence. Most people see God as impersonal and therefore they do not progress.\nDean and Susannah say: \"That's why we need a Guru!\"\nChan says: When we say something isn't real, then it's impersonal. When we personalize\nsomething, we make it real. So then, what is reality?\nYou are the Reality. You are not the thoughts, you are not the emotions nor actions. You are not even a person...!\nExercise: What you now see as impersonal, see it as personal. And when you feel any negative emotion towards anybody, see them as impersonal.

But rather you should have compassion, or even pity, isn't it?\nThere is also a positive aspect of ego. It drives one to do some work. A person will do a job either out of compassion or out of ego. Most of the work in the society is by boosting the ego. But in Satsang, work is done out of love. Ego is separateness; non-belongingness. It is wanting to prove and to possess.\nAnd when you wake up and see, there is nothing to be proved and nothing to possess, ego dissolves.",

That very pinch will take you out of the mistake.\nA mistake means something that brings misery to you in the long run. So why would someone knowingly commit a mistake?\nWhile pointing out a mistake to someone, do you consider him as separate from you and go on pointing out his error or do you make him feel a part of you? When you point out a mistake to someone, does it make him more stressed, or does it create more awareness in that person? Often you do not point out someone's mistake when it is required. Not pointing out a mistake -- with due consideration to time and place -- is also a mistake.\nDo not lament over your mistake. Just take the lesson from it. You will not be judged by your mistakes, but by your virtues. Mistakes are of the earth.

Faith is a great wealth; it is a blessing.\nIf you lack faith, you have to pray for faith. But to pray, you need faith. This is a paradox.

You need to have faith in yourself -- without faith, you think, I can't do this. This is not for me. I will never be liberated in this life. You must have faith in the world. Without this, you cant move an inch in the world. Banks give you loans having faith that you will pay it back. You deposit money in the bank having faith that it will be returned.

This is not stepping out of the rational mind (though they think it is).\nWe step out of the rational mind when we do something that has no purpose. Accepting that, as an act, makes it a game. Life becomes lighter. If you are stuck with only rational acts, life becomes a burden. Suppose you play a game without a thought to winning or losing, just act irrationally. Making an act without any purpose attached to it - it is freedom - like a dance.\nSo just step out of the rational mind and you will  find a greater freedom, an unfathomable depth, and you willl come face to face with reality.

Until you transcend the rational mind you will not get access to creativity and the infinite.\nBut if you do an irrational act in order to find freedom, then it already has a purpose and a meaning.

Suffering is the shrinking or contraction of consciousness.\nWhen consciousness moves through the body in limited channels, \n  pleasure is experienced. Repeated enjoyment of the stimuli causes inertia and \n  dullness. Often cooks don't enjoy their own food. Listening to the same piece \n  of music loses the charm, people in the sex industry don't enjoy sex. If the \n  stimuli are observed, then consciousness expands and becomes peace. With awareness \n  the stimuli lose their significance; whether they exist or not makes no difference. \n  When the sun is there, then whether the candle is lit or not makes no difference. \n  To realise that all pleasures are just stimuli and that you are more than the \n  stimuli brings freedom.\nPain is nothing but consciousness wanting to expand and to \n  become free. Freedom basically is liberation from the craving of the stimuli. \n  Pain is not a permanent state. The natural tendency of consciousness is to expand, \n  to become bliss. Like the natural tendency of water is to flow downward, and \n  the natural tendency of air is not to be under pressure, the natural tendency \n  of consciousness is to expand and to be at peace. Like the person who is an \n  insomniac and has forgotten how to sleep, most of us have forgotten to be at \n  peace and in bliss.",

        "text": "DEPENDENCE, INDEPENDENCE, INTERDEPENDENCE AND ONENESS\nThe body is dependent on the whole creation. In society, somebody \n  has to make clothes, produce electricity, drill for oil. The body cannot be \n  independent of the world. For the body, dependency is absolute. When the Spirit \n  identifies with the body, then it gets pinched and looks for independence. Mind, \n  intellect, ego - they all look for independence.\nIn looking for independence often you get stuck in the ego \n  and become more miserable. Most people are not aware of their dependency. When \n  they become aware of their limitations and dependency, the desire for independence \n  arises. Independence cannot be achieved unless you start moving from within. \n  When you move within, you discover that you are interdependent. Individual Self/Soul/Jeeva \n  is interdependence and in fact every wise person knows that everything is interdependent \n  and that there is nothing like independence.\nOn one level dependency is a harsh reality. On another level, \n  it is an illusion because there is nothing else but the Self. It's only when \n  you don't feel oneness, belongingness that you want independence. The Self being \n  non-dual, there is no question of dependence or independence. One who asks for \n  independence is a beggar. One who knows that it is an illusion is a King. When \n  the sense of belongingness is not well founded, then there is a volatile state \n  in the life of a seeker. Then the ego finds some excuse to revert to smallness. \n  It is not yet totally soaked in the totality of knowledge. As it is not used \n  to it, the mind finds every little excuse to revert back to the ego and to be \n  aloof and independent and separate and it would find any small fault and blow \n  it out of proportion. Be aware of these tendencies and come what may, be strong \n  in the commitment to the Satsang, the Path.",

All that you seek in your life is bliss, that divine union with your source, and everything else in the world distracts you from that goal.  There are a zillion things to distract you from that goal in so many ways.  So many unexplainable, incomprehensible ways of not coming home.\nThe mind is kept alive by cravings and aversions - shoulds or should nots and wants.  Only when the mind dies does the bliss dawn.  Bliss is the abode of all divinity, all devas.  It is possible only in this human body to comprehend, to uphold, and having had a human life and having known this path, if you still do not realize this - you are at the greatest loss.  The cravings and aversions make your heart hard.  There is no use in being polite in your behavior. You can be rude in your behavior but you cannot be rough in your heart.  If you are rude in your behavior, it is acceptable, but not if you are rough in your heart.  The world does not care how you are inside.  It only looks to your behavior.  The Divine does not care how you are outside ï¿½ It only looks to your inside.  Never let any tiny bit of dislike or craving house in your heart.  Let it be fresh, soft and fragrant like a rose.\nIt is such an illusion ï¿½ you dislike someone or something, and this only makes you hard and your hardness takes a long time to soften, to disappear.  It is such a trap for keeping you away from the treasure.  Nothing in this material world can give you contentment.  An outer-looking mind seeking for contentment gets discontented and the discontentment grows, and complaints and negativity start hardening the brain, clouding the awareness (the aura), and forming a huge cloud of negative energy.  When the negativity reaches its peak, like an overloaded balloon, it bursts and comes back to the Divinity.  You can never escape the Divine, the long route of negativity, or the instantaneous positive approach.  When the Divinity dawns, in no time the shift happens from the untruth to truth, from darkness to light, from the dull inert matter to the sparkling spirit.  When the heart is hard, there is no fun.  You cannot experience fun.",

You cannot resist everything and you cannot welcome everything!\nYou don't welcome all thoughts that come to your mind.  When you welcome a thought, it means you find it good and act on it.  If you act on all thoughts that come to your mind, you will end up in a mental hospital or in prison.  So, you resist or ignore some thoughts and welcome other thoughts.  You need discrimination in life.  Welcoming and resisting is a swing in life.\nWelcoming is essential for expansion and growth, and resistance is essential for maintenance.\nAudience:  But what you resist persists!\nGuruji:  If you resist a cold it does not persist!  If there is no resistance in your body you cannot survive.  Your body resists something and welcomes something.\nWhere the resistance is weak, the persistence happens.  A weak resistance makes the opposition persist.  A strong resistance erases the opposition.  Strong resistance leads to valour, power and samadhi (equanimity).  It brings in you the strength of a warrior. Nothing can tempt you, nothing can obstruct you.   Then the victory is gained without fighting.  Where there is strong resistance or total welcome, the victory is gained without any fighting.",

We have faith in God, do not try to know God.   We have faith in Self, do not try to know Self. You can't have faith in that which you make an object of knowing.  A thing to know is an object of knowing.  You have made it into an object of knowing.  Whatever you have faith in, you do not need to know about it.  Do not make that something you have faith in, an object of knowing.  Like you have faith in God, you cannot make God an object of knowing; like you have faith in yourself, you can't make the Self an object of knowing.Q. Are faith and belief the same?Guruji: Belief is a little diluted, faith is little strong, more concrete.   Our beliefs can change, faith is firm.  Faith is yogurt, belief is buttermilk. (Laughter....)\nLike a child has faith in the mother, the child does not make the mother into an object of knowing.  The child does not try to know the mother, it simply has faith in the mother.  When you have faith, what is the need to know it?  You cannot make love an object of knowing, if you try to make love an object of knowing, if you try to know it, it will disappear.In the same way you cannot make Self, or God an object of knowing.  God, love, sleep, and Self are beyond knowing.  If you try to analyze, doubt comes in and faith will disappear.  So whatever you want to have faith in, do not want to know it or analyze it.  The moment you make something an object of knowing then analysis starts and then doubt follows.  Analysis creates a distance, synthesis brings it together.  Faith is synthesis, knowing is analysis.Barbara: Can you have faith without being aware of it?Guruji: Yes. You have faith.  Consciousness cannot exist without faith.  Faith is a relaxed, stable, quality of consciousness.  It is like the flame of a candle.  The nature of consciousness is faith.Theologians analyze too much.  They study 5 to 6 years and then they lose their faith.\nA story: Jyoti once met an officer in-charge of religious affairs.  The minister was so sure that no one can have spiritual experiences.  She gave him a short talk on spirituality and she concluded by saying,  \"I believe in what I experience.\"  His comment was, \"I am glad to hear that you too are anatheist!\"  Another ANALYSIS by a theologian has recently concluded that Jesus never existed.Nick: Does God have faith in us?Guruji: I don't know?!! (Laughter - very non-analytical!!) To know whether God has faith or not, you have to analyze.  If you ask whether God has faith in us then you give God also a mind, which is not true.",

There is nothing to gain if you have only come to give and serve.  Success indicates non-supremacy. Success means what?  It indicates that there are chances of failure.  If something is supreme there is nothing to lose.  People running after success only exhibit their limitations.\nSuccess means crossing a limit.  To cross a limit you need to assume that you have a limit.  Assuming a limit is underestimating yourself.  If you have no boundaries then where is your success?  If you have limitless access then there is no success.  You don't say that you successfully drank a glass of water, because it is well within your capabilities.  But when you do something that is beyond your perceived limits you claim success.\nWhen you realise your unboundedness then no action is an achievement.\nAnyone who claims to be successful only reveals his limitation.  If you feel very successful it means that you have underestimated yourself.  All your gains can only be smaller than you.  Taking pride in any gains is belittling yourself.\nSheila: What if you feel that you are not serving successfully?\nGuruji: You may feel that you have not done enough but you will not feel that you have not been successful.

When religion and politics \n  don't coexist then you have corrupt politicians and pseudo-religious leaders.\nA religious man who is righteous and loving will definitely \n  care for the welfare of the whole population and hence becomes a true politician. \n  And a true politician can only be righteous and loving. He cannot be anything \n  but religious. All the Avatars and prophets have been caring for people and \n  so were in politics. You can find many examples to this effect.\nWhen religions restrict the freedom to worship and restrict \n  modes of worship they become unsuitable for creating a harmonious society. When \n  religion becomes all encompassing and gives full freedom to pray and worship \n  in any manner -- that religion will bring righteousness and peace in people \n  and will be suitable for any society.\nPeople think politics and religion have to be kept separate \n  because many religions did not give freedom to worship and did not care for \n  all people equally. History has shown that religion has created conflict. But \n  irreligious societies (e.g. communism) have created chaos and corruption.\nToday both religion and politics need reform. Religion has \n  to become broader and more spiritual to allow freedom of worship and broader \n  to encompass all the wisdom in the world. And politicians have to become more \n  righteous and spiritual.",

To the degree you have renounced, to that degree you have the ability to love.\nOften people think those who renounce cannot love, and those who love cannot renounce.  This is because so-called renunciants do not seem to be in love, and so-called lovers are very possessive and are in need.\nTrue love is non-possessive and brings freedom, and renunciation is nothing but freedom.  Only in freedom can love fully blossom.  When in love you say, \"I want nothing, I just want this.\"  Renunciation is, \" I don't want anything.  I am free.\"  In love there is no other need. Renunciation is having no need.  Love and renunciation, although appearing to be opposites, are two sides of the same coin.\nMcQueen said -- They are the same side of the same coin. (laughter)\nTara asked -- Does this mean the lover renounces his beloved?\nGuruji responded -- You renounce the attachment, the possessiveness.  Renunciation doesn't diminish love; it enhances it.\nOnly renunciation can sustain love and joy.  Without renunciation love turns into misery, possessiveness, jealousy and anger. Renunciation brings contentment and contentment sustains love.  Without renunciation one gets discontented, frustrated, sad, fearful, suspicious, analytical.  And the whole soap opera begins.  And this is what we find in society , don't we?\nThe so-called renunciants have run away from life frustrated and disappointed.  Real renunciation is born out of knowledge and wisdom, knowledge of life in the background of time and space and in the context of this magnanimous universe.",

How a soul takes a body, the criteria for selecting the place of birth, time of birth, type of body, parents, etc are all a secret.\n2.  Maranarahasya (the secret of death)\nDeath is a highly guarded secret.  Death remains a mystery.  The process of separation of spirit from matter and its journey from then on is a secret.\nThe principles of governing; the principles of maintaining the orderliness in creation are a secret.\n4.  Prakritirahasya (the secret of nature)\nNature is a mystery. The more you know about nature, the mystery deepens. The more a scientist knows, the more he feels there is much more to know.  Science, though appearing to resolve the mystery in creation, has deepened it. The knowledge of particles, wave functions, black holes, the vacuum state, etc have only deepened the mystery.\n5.  Mantrarahasya (secret of mantras)\nThe mantras and their effect, influence, method and mode of working are all a mystery.  Mantras are the impulses or rhythms of consciousness, which itself is a mystery.\nUsually in the West, a secret is shameful and dishonest.  But in the East, it is honored and regarded as sacred.",

You are asking for forgiveness because you feel a pinch and you want to be free from it, isn't it? Let the pinch be there. The pinch will not let the mistake happen again. Forgiveness removes the pinch and you keep repeating the mistake!\nQuestion: How do you know a mistake is a mistake?\nSri Sri: A mistake is something that gives you a pinch. If it hasn't pinched you, it is not a mistake at all.\nIt is the pinch that irks the consciousness and that pinch disallows the mistake to be repeated. Be with the pinch and not the guilt. It is a very fine balance.\nQuestion: What is the difference between guilt and pinch?\nSri Sri: Guilt is about a specific action and pinch is about a specific result or happening. You can only feel guilty about what you did and not about what happened. But whatever happened, whether because of you or someone else can cause a pinch in you.\nQuestion: How do we get over the guilt?\nTom Gill: Just blame the boss!!! ( laughter)\nSri Sri: Through wisdom, by knowing the nature of mind, nature of consciousness and from a broader perspective of the phenomenon, you can get over the guilt.\nQuestion: Cant we learn from our mistakes without feeling the pinch?\nSri Sri: Learning is at an intellectual level whereas you feel the pinch at an emotional level. The drive of your emotions is much stronger than your intellect. So a pinch will not let the mistake recur.\nBharat: We feel guilt where we have control, it is at the intellectual level, whereas a pinch is at the emotional level where we do not have control.\nQuestion: So, should we discard the intellect?\nSri Sri: You cannot be driven by your emotions alone. Your intellect acts like a brake for your emotions!\nFeel the pinch.\nThe pinch will create an awareness that what happened was beyond your capacity.\nThe awareness will bring you to surrender.\nSurrender will free you from guilt.\nSo, from pinch to awareness to surrender to freedom are the steps of evolution.",

Last Friday, Sri Sri addressed three satsangs in a single day, starting with the rural satsang among thousands of poor people of Inchilla, a brief stopover with the enthusiastic devotees of Belgaum, and on to the urban elite of Goa, with the sound of our bhajans reverberating everywhere.\nAhmedabad was all keyed up as Sri Sri returned after a two-year gap.Teachers from all over Gujarat had been working together to make this the biggest satsang ever.  In the morning, over 25, 000 people did the Sudarshan Kriya conducted \"live\" by Sri Sri...Intense experiences, strong fragrances, changes in the weather pattern were happening as three eagles circled directly overhead, joined by a flock of other birds ï¿½ a cosmic rhythm was set in motion. Many people shared that their entire life was one side and this event on the other, such was the magnitude of the experience for them.  Kriya was followed by an elaborate lunch for the participants the network of volunteers had organised 60 counters to feed all of them!\nIn the evening, the same cricket stadium was transformed, with a huge lotus designed up in the stands for Guruji to sit in, and video screens all over the grounds. It was a sight to see streams of people flooding in, all excited and happy even before the program began, the crowd totalled nearly 200,000!  The traffic diversion for the event was announced by the traffic police well in advance, as THE event took off without any chaos.\nFollowing 27 minutes of total, still meditation, the entire crowd were on their feet, singing and dancing ï¿½ the sub-inspector of police remarked that even though a meagre force of 500 was deployed, they had nothing to do, so blissful and orderly was the crowd. The policemen would hug people, and confessed that only their uniform was preventing them from joining the dance. The high priests of the ancient city of Dwarka (Krishna's capital), came all the way to invite Guruji, and placed a resplendent turban (which was from the temple deity) on His head.\nThe next day was the foundation-laying ceremony of the Gujarat ashram on the banks of the river Mahi.  After a brief satsang in Vidyanagar, Guruji addressed over 3,000 Art Excel kids ï¿½ it was the best ever question-and-answer session, with witty one-line exchanges between the little ones and the Wise One.\nEnthusiastic devotees with a live band awaited Guruji at 4 am in Jamnagar.  Guruji visited the ancient capital of Krishna in Dwarka for a Vishnu Yagna in the ancient Dwarkadheesh Temple. The entire city danced as Guruji was taken in a horse-drawn carriage through the streets of Dwarka's  it was a non-stop celebration.\nThat evening, we had another Divine Satsang in Jamnagar, before returning to Ahmedabad. The blissful ones are now in Delhi, en route to Rishikesh.\nPS: The three-year-old daughter of one of our devotees fell from a three-story building recently.  She told her parents later that \"That bearded uncle whose photo we have at home He caught me!\" She escaped totally unhurt.  (Caution: Please don't try this at home!!)\nSPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT:\nDear Ones, Some days ago I posted this on the Satsang email but am not  sure the attachment could be opened so here it is as just a plain old email.  This effort can be coordinated so that politicians can be contacted by one person acting for each Satsang group.  You can contact these folks through the WWW at:  http://government.aol.com/mygov/  or  http://www.senate.gov/  or  http://www.house.gov/\nLove and Peace, Dean\nTHIS COMES FROM INDIA:\nThe Times of India on February 10th came with this article and another about President Clinton's visit to India in March 2000.  In light of the increased awareness of the government of the United States we think that now is the time to awaken all sectors of society to The Art of Living and the projects we are doing around the world, especially our 5H program and our schools in Bangalore, Assam and Bengal.  We would like committees to be formed from Satsang groups to actively participate in contacting their respective Senators and Representatives in each state as soon as possible to convey the vision of the organization and request for full national participation in our service projects in the rural areas of India.  The 5H program involves improvement of the quality of life by addressing Home, Health, Hygiene, Human Values and Harmony in Diversity.

Meditation and breathing can calm you down.  Drop whatever you are doing and do something completely irrelevant, e.g. while decorating your\nhouse, take a moment off to cut grass, or go shopping!  When you are doing something very important, take a moment off to do something totally irrelevant and insignificant. This enhances your creativity.  Relevant action keeps you bound to the action.

When the ten are used skillfully, radiance is born within.\nRama was born in Ayodhya (Sanskrit for \"the place where no war can happen\"). When there is no conflict in our mind, then the radiance can dawn.\nLakshmana, the brother of Rama, was born of Sumitra ï¿½ the good friend.  When the ten are cooperating with you then Awareness is born.\nOften we try to look for radiance within.  Just realize that you are radiant.  Once when Guruji was 5 or 6 years old, he closed his eyes and asked a visiting saint, \"Swamiji, I do not see any light\".  The saint replied, \"You are the light!  How can you see the light?\"",

When you think that others are responsible, then your degree of responsibility diminishes.\nWhen you are in total Vairagya (dispassion), you can take care of even trivial and insignificant things with such perfection. For example, during the Pooja every morning, Guruji decorates the Pooja table with flowers with such great care, choosing different color combinations and patterns everyday; fully knowing that the decoration is not going to last even 10 minutes. After the Pooja He himself would remove the garlands from the Pooja table or shower people with the flowers on it. Yet even while He is in a deep state of Samadhi, He would effortlessly and lovingly decorate the Pooja table everyday. It is obvious that it does not matter how the flowers are kept, but still attention to even such a trivial thing with such keenness of awareness can only come through utter dispassion.\nPerfection is the very nature of the Enlightened one.",

Love is the shadow of the Self.\nThe bigger the Self, the bigger the shadow, and the bigger the love.\nWhen the love is cast over the entire creation, then you are the Big Self.

There are many stories associated with this day.\nIt was this day that the demon Narakasaura was killed. King Narakasura (Naraka means hell) had been granted a boon that he could be destroyed only by a woman. Lord KrishnaÒ³ wife Satyabhama was the one to destroy him.\nWhy only Satyabhama could kill Naraka? Satya means truth and bhama means the beloved. Untruth or lack of love cannot conquer hell.  It cannot be removed by aggression. Hell can only be erased by love and surrender. Non-aggression, love and surrender are the inherent qualities of a woman. Hence only Satyabhama, the true beloved could remove hell and bring the light back. And NarakasuraÒ³ last wish was that every house should celebrate his exit with lights to mark the end of darkness. This is Deepawali.\nAlso it was today that Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya, his Kingdom, after his victory over Ravana, the demon king. Ayodhya means that which cannot be destroyed, i.e. life. Ram means the Atma (the Self). When Self rules in life, then knowledge lights up. There is life everywhere. But when the spirit is awakened in life, deepawali happens.",

Being very clear means not opening to new possibilities and can lead to limitations. Unlimited possibilities are open to one who is not clear and not confused.\nYour mind swings from clarity to confusion and confusion to clarity but the state in which there is no doership nor inertia is the most creative and progressive state.\nSharmila: Will this not lead to lethargy?\nSri Sri: No. A sharp instrument does its job perfectly, effortlessly.\nSharmila: What about focus?\nSri Sri: Focus is natural to a dynamic consciousness.\nConfusion arises when new information flows in and clarity is lost. Then confusion again seeks clarity. Clarity constricts the possibility of new information. A confused consciousness seeks clarity and every confusion is breaking away from clarity.\nIf there is only confusion, there is frustration. If there is only clarity, there is rigidity.\nAfter giving contradictory knowledge, Krishna tells Arjuna, \"Just be Nimit!\" And to be an instrument, the prerequisite is to be madly in love!

        "text": "SACREDNESS AND YOU\nThroughout the ages, in all cultures, place, time, persons and symbols were all considered sacred. Whenever you consider a symbol, place, time, person or act sacred, your attention is undivided and whole. When things are ordinary and same, you tend to slip into unawareness and inertia. The moment you consider something sacred, your inertia disappears and you become more alive. There is nothing as fulfilling as a sacred act. You put your heart and soul in a sacred act. When every action of yours becomes sacred, you have become one with the Divine. Then every minute of your life is sacred, every place you go to becomes sacred, every person you meet is only your reflection, and every act of yours is sacred.\nQuestion: Why does an act when performed repeatedly lose it sacredness?\nSri Sri: This happens when your memory overpowers your consciousness and you lose your sensitivity. For example, people living in Benares do not feel that it is a sacred place. That sensitivity is just not there.\nQuestion: How can we preserve that feeling of sacredness in our acts?\nSri Sri: Through living in the present moment and through Sadhana. Your Sadhana will not allow your memory to overpower consciousness. Repetition is not a hindrance then.\nThe Native American Indians and the tribals consider the earth, sun, moon and all the directions as sacred. In the ancient tradition, the Rishis considered all the rivers, mountains and even animals, trees and herbs as sacred. What to say of people? They are definitely sacred!\nIn different parts of the world, certain symbols, certain places and different times of the year are considered sacred. Various cultures honor certain people and consider them as sacred. For example, Christians consider the Cross, Jerusalem, Christmas and the Pope as sacred. For Muslims, the Crescent Moon, Mecca and the month of Ramadan are sacred. The Hindus consider the river Ganges, the Himalayas and the Swamis as sacred.\nIt is good to begin feeling that some symbols, places, time and people are sacred so that you can be awake and alive. But eventually you need to transcend and feel that the entire creation and your whole life is sacred. For the man of God, the whole world, with all its symbols, places and people are sacred at all times.\nBE A MAN OF GOD!",

All the opposites are part of relative existence.\nRelative existence is not the complete picture. Good and bad, right and wrong, everything is relative.

These are neither absolutely good nor bad; they are just there.\nTruth transcends duality, and God is the absolute and only truth.

So some people prefer to be atheists.\nAtheism is not a reality, it is just a matter of convenience. When you have a spirit of enquiry, or in search of truth, atheism falls apart. With a spirit of enquiry, you cannot deny something which you have not disproved. An atheist denies God without first disproving it. In order to disprove God, you must have enormous knowledge. And when you have enormous knowledge, you cannot disprove it! (laughter!)For one to say that something does not exist, one should know about the whole universe. So you can never be one hundred percent atheist. An atheist is only a believer who is sleeping!\nFor a person to say, \"I don't believe in anything\", means he must believe in himself - so he believes in himself about whom he does not even know!\nAn atheist can never be sincere because sincerity needs depth - and an atheist refuses to go to his depth. Because the deeper he goes, he finds a void, a field of all possibilities - he has to accept that there are many secrets he does not know. He would then need to acknowledge his ignorance, which he refuses to do, because the moment he is sincere, he seriously starts doubting his atheism. A doubt-free atheist is next to impossible!

        "text": "ATHEISM\nAtheism is when one does not believe either in values or in the abstract. When an atheist comes to the Guru, what happens? You start experiencing your own form and discover that you are indeed formless, hollow and empty. And this abstract non-form in you becomes more and more concrete!!!\nThe guru makes the abstract more real and what you thought as solid appears to be more unreal. Sensitivity and subtlety dawns. Perception of love, not as an emotion, but as the substratum of existence becomes evident. The formless spirit shines through every form in creation and mystery of life deepens, shattering the atheism. Then the journey begins and it has four stages.\nThe first stage is Saarupya (to see the formless in the form) ï¿½ Seeing God in all the forms. Often, one feels more comfortable to see God as formless rather than with a form, because with a form, one feels a distance, a duality, a fear of rejection and other limitations. In life all of our interactions are with the form, other than in deep sleep and in Samadhi. And, if you do not see God in the form, then the waking part of life remains devoid of the Divine. All those who accept God to be formless use symbols, and perhaps love the symbols more than God himself! If God comes and tells a Christian to leave the cross or a Muslim to drop the crescent, perhaps he may not do it! To begin with loving the formless is possible only through forms.\nThe second stage is Saamipya (closeness) ï¿½ feeling absolutely close to the form you have chosen and reaching out to the formless. This leads to a sense of intimacy with the whole creation. In this stage, one overcomes the fear of rejection and other fears. But this is time and space bound.\nThe third stage is Saanidhya - feeling the presence of the Divine by which you transcend the limitations of time and space.\nThen the final stage ï¿½ Saayujya ï¿½ is when you are firmly entrenched with the Divine. It is then you realize you are one with the Divine. There is a total merging with the Beloved and all duality disappears.\nTHIS IS THAT AND THAT IS THIS.\nVinod Mathur: Does a believer also go through these four stages?\nSri Sri: Certainly, whether an atheist or believer, he goes through the four stages.",

In life, if you do not adore or appreciate anything, you will be filled with negativity. And a person who has nothing to worship or adore is sure to fall into depression.\nLack of adoration has led to many emotional, psychological and social problems in the society. If you have nothing to hold up high in life, selfishness, arrogance and violence are sure to follow. Adoring and honoring each other in society eliminates stress and fosters compassion and love.\nIn the previous century, it was thought that worshipping was an uncivilized and unintelligent thing to do. Worship was thought to rise from a slavish mentality. In fact it is just the contrary. Worship can only happen through gratefulness and not through slavish mentality.\nIn worship, a sense of belongingness, love, honor and respect all come together. Without a sense of belongingness, worship or idealism can bring low self-esteem. The ancient people knew this so they insisted that people should feel part of what they worship.

A certain degree of aloofness in every relationship will strengthen your personality and connect you to your source.\nVinod Sethi: It's very easy to be very aloof or very friendly. But to be friendly and aloof is a Sadhana.\nHarish: Be an unfriendly friend!!",

        "text": "THE PARADOX OF SACRIFICE\nAll the scriptures of the world glorify sacrifice. What is sacrifice?\nIt is giving up something that you value. You can only sacrifice that which you would like to keep for yourself; in other words, that which gives you pleasure and joy. You cannot sacrifice something that you dislike or disown. Sacrifice is always related to a higher cause for a greater good. At the same time, when your love for the greater good is so strong, nothing else assumes any value. Sacrifice here becomes irrelevant, because love alone is your strongest driving force. So when there is so much love there cannot be sacrifice. At the same time when there is no love, there is no sacrifice.\nFor example, if a mother has made plans to see a movie and she realizes that her child is sick, she does not say that she has sacrificed the movie to nurse her child, because she simply did not want to go. Nothing else seems to charm the mother besides being with her child.\nYou do not sacrifice something for someone you are in love with. Sacrifice indicates that your pleasure has more value than the cause for which you are sacrificing. When the love is lukewarm, then sacrifice assumes meaning. Yet sacrifice purifies the human mind and reins in selfish tendencies. It can also bring pride, arrogance, self-pity and sometimes even depression.\nYou can sacrifice only that which you value. For a wise man nothing is more valuable than truth, values and the Divine, and he will never sacrifice those. God is the greatest, and if he values the greatest then how can he sacrifice God? This is the paradox of sacrifice.",

He creates idols, breathes faith into it and requests divinity to be present in that idol for a while, so that he can worship, express his love and play with it. At the end of his worship he requests divinity to go back into his heart from where divinity manifested. This is in all puja practices.\nThey are not actually worshipping the idols but worshipping the unmanifest divinity which has all the divine qualities. So, the idol worshippers of the East are not the same as the ones in the Middle East as described in the Bible, because they are not just worshipping different gods and different idols, they are worshipping the ONE divinity in many different forms.\nPaganism, Satan and animal worship, without the knowledge of the one divinity is very different from seeing the divine in every form of the manifest universe. In the eastern tradition, gods and goddesses are part of the one divinity like the different colors of white sunlight, whereas in the Greek tradition, gods and goddesses are in themselves different entities.\nWorshipping Satan and different entities is totally different from worshipping divinity in its various forms. Every form belongs to the divine. When you adore the form, you are adoring the divine behind the form.\nWith this knowledge, the very act of worship, which is more an inner phenomenon, assumes a more colorful and vibrant expression, indicating that both the form and the formless are all divine.",

The general notion is that when you work under someone, you lose your freedom, you have to be answerable.\nSo, many people opt for business, wanting to be their own boss. But, in business, you are accountable to so many people. If you cannot be accountable to even one person, how can you be accountable to many? This is the paradox. In fact, being in business binds you more than the boss!\nRefusing to work under someone is a sign of weakness, not strength. A strong person would not feel uncomfortable working under anyone, because he knows his strength. It is the weak and poor in spirit who do not like to work under someone else, because they are unaware of their strength. They can be neither successful in business nor in any profession.\nAnd the same is true even in the field of social service - often volunteers do not want to work under someone else. This is merely an exhibition of their weakness. With such an attitude, they achieve very little.\nOne who is timid and weak in spirit would be uncomfortable to work even under the Wise one; but one who knows his own strength can work effectively even under a fool!\nNityanand: But to work under a fool is frustrating!\nSriSri: When you know your strength, with skill and intelligence, you can turn every disadvantage into an advantage. A fool can bring out the best of your communication skills! (laughter)\nSo watch out! If you feel uncomfortable working under someone, it clearly shows you need to strengthen yourself.

When you move away from that place, the street or the house, you immediately feel better. Chanting, singing, children playing and laughing can change this atmospheric restlessness. If you chant and sing, the vibration in the place changes.\nThe second type of restlessness is in the body. Eating the wrong food or vata aggravating food, eating at odd times, not exercising, and overworking can all cause a physical restlessness. The remedy for this is exercise, moderation in work habits and going on a vegetable or juice diet for one or two days.\nThe third type of restlessness is mental restlessness. It is caused by ambition, strong thoughts, likes or dislikes. Knowledge alone can cure this restlessness. Seeing life from a broader perspective, knowledge about the Self and the impermanence of everything. If you achieve everything, so what? After your achievement, you will die. Knowledge of your death or life, confidence in the Self, in the Divine, can all calm down the mental restlessness.\nThen there is emotional restlessness. Any amount of knowledge does not help here. Only Kriya helps! All that emotional restlessness vanishes. Also the presence of the Guru, a wise person, or a saint will help to calm your emotional restlessness.\nThe fifth type of restlessness is rare. It is the restlessness of the soul. When everything feels empty and meaningless, know you are very fortunate. That longing and restlessness is the restlessness of the soul. Do not try to get rid of it. Embrace it! Welcome it! Usually to get rid of it people do all sorts of things - they change places, jobs or partners, do this, do that. It seems to help for some time, but it does not last.\nThis restlessness of the soul alone can bring authentic prayer in you. It brings perfection, Siddhis and miracles in life. It is so precious to get that inner most longing for the Divine.  Satsang, the presence of the enlightened one, soothes the restlessness of the soul.",

        "text": "TENDENCIES AND INFLUENCES\nLife moves by dual (two) factors: inner tendencies and outer influences.\nInner tendencies form your attitudes and behavior, while external influences makes strong impressions in your mind. Often your tendencies generate external situations. And situations around you can form tendencies within you. This is what is called Karma. Both these factors -  the tendencies from within and influences from outside, can either be beneficial or harmful.\nIt is the awareness that filters the outer negative influences and it is the awareness that corrects and annihilates the unhealthy inner tendencies. This awareness is called Gyana. The purpose of education is to develop this awareness, so that you can be selective about your tendencies and influences.\nIt is practically impossible to resist the external influences and the inner tendencies without raising oneï¿½s consciousness. This can be gradual or sudden. And that is how a human being has both free will and destiny.\nFreedom is when you have a say about your tendencies and your influences. And only awareness and impeccable devotion can bring this freedom.",

Your intentions need to be authentic and your actions need to be skillful. The more authentic the intention, the more skillful the action will be. Authentic intention and skillful action make you unshakable.\nSkill is required only when authenticity cannot have its way. Yet skill without authenticity makes you shallow. You cannot have an authentic action and a skillful intention. If you try to be authentic in your action but manipulative in your mind, that is when mistakes happen.\nJohn: Is it possible to have a powerful intention, like greed, that is authentic?\nSri Sri: If your intention is colored by greed, over-ambition, etc. then your intention is not authentic. Whenever your intentions are impure, it pricks your consciousness, so it cannot be authentic. Authentic intentions are free from negative emotions. An action that is not skillful leads to negative emotions and an intention that is not authentic harbors negative emotions.\nGayatri: If our intention is authentic and yet our actions are not skillful, what should we do?\nSri Sri: Carry a handkerchief (laughter).\nQuestion: What is the best skill to deal with intention?\nSri Sri: Do not keep any sankalpas (intentions) to yourself. Offer them to the Divine.\nActions can never be perfect but our intentions can be perfect. Actions always have room for improvement. Action means growth and movement, and that needs space.\nThe depth in you and the freedom in you bring out all the skillfulness in you.

Place, time, mood of mind are factors that influence celebration. Snatch every opportunity to celebrate, then you feel great and full. Then celebration infiltrates your mind in all moods and space, and celebration is inevitable. Celebration reminds you of the fullness of the moment. The moments you are in the company of knowledge - the Master - are the most precious moments in your life. Treasure them. Treasuring them you transcend the mind, time and space.

But even if you correct it, this does not work.\n2. You correct someoneï¿½s mistake, not because it bothers you, but for their sake so that they can grow.\nTo correct mistakes you need authority and love. Authority and love seem to be contradictory, but in reality they are not. Authority without love is stifling and does not work. Love without authority is shallow. A friend needs to have both authority and love but they need to be in the right combination. This can happen if you are totally dispassionate and centered.\nWhen you allow room for mistakes, you can be both authoritative and sweet. That is how the Divine is, the right balance of both. Krishna and Jesus had both. People, when they are in love, exercise authority with each other. Authority and love exist in all relationships.\nAbhay says, \"The husband just loves and the wife has authority.\"\nMikey asks, \"Is that a mistake?\"\nGuruji says, \"I donï¿½t want to correct it!\" (laughter)",

Adults put brakes on their feelings and they start worrying.  Worrying about anything obstructs action while feelings propel action.  Worrying about negative feelings is a blessing because it puts the brakes on those feelings, preventing you from acting on them.  Usually one never worries about positive feelings.  Worries are uncertain.  Worrying takes away your energy; you cannot think clearly when you worry.\nOffering your worries is prayer and prayer moves you in feelings.\nWhen you think you are feeling too much then you start worrying about your feelings.  Letï¿½s not worry about it and feel our food!",

This respect, no one can take away.\nThe less you are attached to your virtues, the more self respect you have. If you get attached to your virtues, you look down upon everybody else and they (the virtues) start diminishing. Non- attachment to virtues brings the highest self respect.\nOften one confuses ego with self esteem. Ego needs the other for comparision, self esteem is just confidence in oneself. For example, a gentleman claims that he is thorough in Mathematics or Geography, this is self esteem. But to say that I know better than you, that is Ego.\nEgo simply means lack of respect to the Self.\nEgo upsets you very often. Self esteem is immune to getting upset by external factors.

All the five elements - Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether - can be measured.\nQuestion: Can space be measured?\nSri Sri: Only in space can things be measured. Space is the first dimension of measurement.\nMeasurement is always relative and not absolute. Example: If something weighs 6 kilos on the earth, it then weighs only 1 kilo on the moon. The light of the star you see today is not really today's light. It has taken at least 4 years for the light to reach you! Both size and weight change in air, water and earth. So \"measure\" is illusive and not dependable. Your bones, skin, body, environment and five elements can be measured; you can put a value to it. So, the whole world is Maya!\nAll measures are relative understanding. Einstein's theory of relativity correlates with the Advaita (non-dual) philosophy.\nBut what is not Maya? All that cannot be measured is not Maya. You cannot say 1 ounce of love, 2 ounces of peace, 5 kilos of happiness, Can YOU be measured? It is not possible. Your body has weight, but not YOU. Truth cannot be measured, Ananda (joy) cannot be measured, beauty cannot be measured. All these are part of Consciousness or Easwara (Divine) and are called MAYI.",

Sometimes truth can make love bitter while in love even lies can appear sweet, like Krishnaï¿½s lies to his mother Yashoda!\nThe truth that does not nourish love has no sense and the love that cannot withstand the truth is not true love. When one is assured that the love is so strong that the truth can neither break it nor cause bitterness, then the truth prevails and love shines.\nTruth has judgments, but true love is beyond judgments.

        "text": "THE STRENGTH OF COMMITMENT\nQuestion: Why is it easier for some of us to commit to our own welfare rather than that of others?\nSri Sri: Because you do not know that whatever you are committed to brings you strength.If you are committed to your family then your family supports you, if you are committed to your society, you enjoy the support of society.  If you are committed to God, God gives you strength.  If you are committed to Truth, Truth brings you strength.\nOften one is not aware of this idea and that is why one is hesitant to commit to a greater cause. Also there is a fear that commitment would weaken one or take away one's freedom. Your commitment to a cause is bound to bring you comfort in the long run.\nCommitment in life grows toward a higher cause. The higher the commitment, greater is the good for all.\nNoah: Why don't we make any vows in the Art of Living?\nSri Sri: When the path is charming, commitment is effortless and is part of your nature.\nMikey: In Art of Living we don't make vows, we have Wows!

        "text": "TWO TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE\nThere are two types of knowledge. \nThe first one is pure knowledge and the second one is applied knowledge.\nApplied knowledge may benefit you directly and immediately but pure knowledge benefits you indirectly in the long run.\nIf there are some things that you have studied or understood that you are unable to put into practice, do not get disheartened. Sometime in the future, if you do not discard the knowledge you have as impractical, it will be of use to you.\nOften people discard the pure knowledge for its lack of immediate application. In fact these two types of knowledge compliment each other. Applied knowledge without pure knowledge remains weak.  And pure knowledge without application will remain unfulfilled.\nDo not discard or label the knowledge as impractical. Do not label yourself as weak or unworthy because you are unable to apply the knowledge in your day-to-day life.\nSometimes when you are alone in nature, silent, taking a walk, looking at the sand on the beach, a bird in the sky, or while meditating  ï¿½ suddenly the knowledge will emerge and you will recognize the knowledge dawning in your life.",

        "text": "Faith and alertness appear to be completely opposite in nature. When you are alert, usually there is no faith and you feel restless and insecure. When there is faith the mind is secure and rested and you are not alert.\nThere are three types of faith:\nTamasic faith which is because of dullness. Like when you do not want to take responsibility or action and you say, \"Oh it doesnï¿½t matter, anyway God will take care of all these things!\"  (laughter)\nRajasic faith which is brought on by intense compulsion of desires and ambition. The ambition keeps the faith alive.\nSatvic faith is innocent and is born out of fullness of consciousness.\nFaith and alertness, though apparently opposite in nature, are actually complementary to each other. In the absence of faith there can be no growth, and without alertness there can be no correct understanding. Faith can make you complacent. Alertness makes you tense.\nIf there is no faith, there is fear. And when there is no alertness one cannot perceive or express properly. A combination of both is essential.\nIn Gyana (state of wisdom) there is alertness without tension and faith without complacency. The purpose of education should be to remove the element of dullness from faith and the element of fear from alertness. This is a unique and rare combination. If you have faith and alertness at the same time, then you will become a true Gyani (the Wise One)!",

It is simply a broader perspective of reality. Dispassion is moving towards the source. Dispassion simply means the way back home. It is the journey towards the source, which is a reservoir of enthusiasm.\nWhen dispassion and enthusiasm co-exist, that is the secret of perennial enthusiasm and profound dispassion.
