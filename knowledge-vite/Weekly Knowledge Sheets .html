  	    <p align="CENTER"><b>THIS BEGINS A NEW PRACTICE</b></p>
<p>This begins a new practice of weekly dispatches of Knowledge from Guruji. Every center around the world will receive the Knowledge so it can be read for people to copy down at weekly Satsang. Here is the first segment Guruji dictated at Big Sur, 21 June, 1995.</p>
<p align="CENTER">* * * *</p>
<p>Beyond an event is Knowledge.	</p>
<p>Beyond a person is love.</p>
<p>Beyond an object is infinity.</p>
<p>Knowledge is not in an event; it is beyond an event.</p>
<p>If you take one event and infer anything from one event -- infer knowledge -- it will be erroneous knowledge. Say Nancy gets angry and shouts at someone. You attribute anger to Nancy, but actually it was carried from someone else to her. Someone else got angry first and someone else and someone else and on and on like that.</p>
<p>When you go beyond an event, only then the truth dawns. One particular event gives you a false notion. So you have to consider the totality of events, the totality of all events infinitely. Beyond the event is Knowledge.</p>
<p>What do we call a person? A person is a body, a mind, a complex of behaviors which is changing. Love is unchanging. Beyond the person is love.</p>
<p>When you lose your personality, you become love. If you cannot lose yourself, you cannot find yourself. So, lose your personality; you'll find yourself!!!</p>
<p>Behind every object is infinity. An object is limited. Take an object and reduce, reduce, reduce, and you have an atom. An atom is infinity. Each atom contains infinite space. Beyond the object is infinity.</p>
<p>The object behind the object is infinity. The person behind the person is love.</p>
<p>Maya is getting caught up in the event, personality, object. Knowledge, love, Brahman is seeing beyond the event, personality, or object. See? Just a little shift.</p>

  		<font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">
  	    <p align="CENTER"><b>CLOSE TO THE MASTER</b></p>
<p>If you're not feeling close to the Guru, it's because of you. Because of your mind, because of your ego concepts. Share with the Guru that which is very important or intimate to you. Share that. Do not feel shame, shy, or judgmental about yourself. </p>
<p>Unless you express to the Master that which is very intimate and important to you, just being on the formal and informal communication levels cannot make you feel close. "How are you, where are you going? How have you been?" Stop formal and superficial conversations with the Master and speak with your heart that which is very important and intimate, very deep to your life. Don't just say how much the squash costs, 30 cents or whatever.</p>
<p>If you don't feel close to the Master, there's no point in having a Master. It is just another burden to you. You have enough already. Just say "Goodbye," get rid of it.</p>
<p>Question: When you play little games and push us away, how can we feel close to you?</p>
<p>Answer: You should feel more close if you are pushed away, scolded or ignored. Because to ignore somebody takes a lot of effort. When a Master does not even ignore wrapping paper, or a flower that is in a vase, how can he ignore a walking, talking, breathing human being who is connected? How could that be ignored? So when you understand this, you already feel close.</p>
<p>Question: Can we call you every week?</p>
<p>Response from the room: Call Guruji every week and if he doesn't answer the phone then you know you are loved.</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, put that in. 	(Laughter)</p>
<p>You are with the Master to share the joy of the Master, to share the consciousness of the Master. For that, you have to empty your cup of what is already in it. So you share that with the Master. You share whatever you have and don't judge, "Oh, that is garbage." The Master is ready to accept any garbage of any extent. However you are, he will embrace you. He is ready to share. You only have to share from your side.</p>

<p>Some karma can be changed and some cannot.</p>
<p>When you prepare halwa, if sugar is less or ghee is less, water more or less, it can all be adjusted, repaired. But once soji is cooked, it cannot be reversed.</p>
<p>If the buttermilk is sour, milk can be added, salt can be added to make it drinkable. But it can never be reversed back to milk.</p>
<p>Prabdha karma cannot be changed. Sanchita karma can be changed by spiritual practices. Satsang burns the seed of all negative karma.</p>
<p>When you praise someone, you take on their good karma. When you blame someone you take on their bad karma.</p>
<p>Know this and surrender both good and bad karma to the Divine and be free.</p>

  		<font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">
  	    <p align="CENTER"><b>ONLY SPEAK KNOWLEDGE</b></p>
<p>Only speak Knowledge. Don't repeat anything that someone tells you or opinions about anyone that someone states -- "That so-and-so said such-and-such about you." If someone comes to tell you such things, discourage them. Don't believe it. </p>
<p>If someone blames you directly, know that they are taking away your bad karma and let it go. Don't believe in it, and if you're one of the Guru's close ones, you will take all of the blame of the world with a smile. </p>
<p>Conflict is the nature of the world; comfort is the nature of the self. Amidst the conflict seek the comfort. </p>
<p>When you are bored with the comfort, get into the games of the world. When you are tired of the games of the world, get into the comforts of the Self. If you are one of the Guru's close ones, you do both simultaneously. Trying to end conflict prolongs it. Face the conflict by seeking the comfort of the Self. </p>
<p>God is alive in the world and has been putting up with all the ongoing conflicts throughout the ages. If God can put up with all the conflicts, you can too. The moment you agree to be with the conflict, the conflict disappears.</p>
<p>People who love peace do not want to fight, and those who fight do not love peace. Those who want peace want to run away. What is needed here is to be peaceful within and then fight. The whole message of the Gita is to be peaceful yourself and then fight. Krishna tells Arjuna to fight but be in peace at the same time. Does this ring a bell?</p>
<p>In the world, you resolve one conflict and another one comes up. For example, Russia is solved and then Bosnia arises. You make one better, and then another starts up. Your body gets a cold, then you get better; then your back hurts, then it gets better. Your body gets better, and then the mind goes. The world runs like this, isn't it?</p>
<p>Without any intention, misunderstandings happen. It's not up to you to try to resolve them. Ignore them and be alive.</p>

  	    <p align="CENTER"><b>MASTER IS A DOORWAY</b></p>
<p>Master is a doorway. And the doorway needs to be more charming than the world so that you will come to the doorway. Someone is in the street and there is rain, thunder, hot sun; they need shelter. They look around, they find a doorway. They come to the doorway. The doorway is more inviting, more charming, more celebrative, more joyful than anything else in the world.</p>
<p>Nothing could give that much peace, joy, pleasure in the world. Once you come to the doorway, you enter the door and see the world from there. See the world from the eyes of the Master. This is a sign that you have come to the Master. Otherwise you may still be standing in the street and looking at the door. </p>
<p>But once you have entered the door, then you will see the whole world from the eyes of the Master. This means what? In every situation that you face, you will think, "If this situation comes in front of the Master, how would he handle it?" or "How would she handle it?" "If this complication comes in front of the Master, how would he take it?" "If someone blames the Master like this, how would he handle it?" See the world from the eyes of the Master all the time.</p>
<p>The world looks much more beautiful; not a nasty place. But a place filled with love, filled with joy, cooperation, compassion, and all virtues. The world is much more fun. Looking through the doorway, there is no fear. You will look at the world without any fear. You will be in all relationships with everybody without any fear. Because there is shelter. </p>
<p>From inside home, you will look at the thunder, you will look at the storm, you will look at the rain, you will look at the bright sun. Inside you have air conditioning. Very cool, pleasant. Outside it's hot. You donҴ mind because there is nothing that can really distract you, disturb you, or take the fullness away from you. Such a sense of security, such a sense of fullness and joy comes. That is the purpose of having a Master.</p>
<p>All relationships in the world go topsy-turvy. You make relationships and you break relationships. All relationships can get broken or made up and again broken. And there is craving and aversion. This is the world. This is samsara.</p>
<p>But the Master is not a relationship. The Master is the Presence. What is necessary is to feel the Presence of the Master, not to make a relationship. Don't make the Master a part of your world. Then the same, "Oh, he looked at me." "He didn't look at me." "Oh, he said this." "He didn't say that." "Oh, somebody is close. I am not close." All this garbage comes into it. You feel the Presence of the Master, that is eternal. That has been there with you before, now, and will be there in the future, too.</p>
<p>Master is the Presence. World is relativity. And relativity has limitations. Presence is unlimited. Presence is vast, infinite, and all comprehensive, all inclusive. And the presence of the Master in one's life will bring fulfillment to all relations. Every relationship will become complete with the presence of the Infinity if the Master is in your life. </p>

Accepting it either as black or as white. Put it either as black and accept it or as white and accept it -- whether or not it is black or white. And see the gray as a shade of black or white. Either way you accept it. Honest or dishonest -- accept it. Then the mind is quiet. You are not in the gray area.</p>
<p>See, the eyes are dark, eyebrows are dark, the thymus -- the most powerful organ of the body -- is black. Hemoglobin -- the main force of the body -- is black. You cannot survive without black. It is part of you.</p>
<p>Or see it as white. Eye is also white. Bones are white; the structure on which the whole body stands is white. Put it in a category of black -- no problem -- accept. Put it in a category of white -- no problem -- doubt is not there. Have conviction. "I accept. They are dishonest and still part of me." That's it. Finished.</p>

<p>&nbsp;You are also like fire. Are you the fire that creates smoke and pollution or the flame of camphor which creates light and fragrance? A saint is like a camphor flame that creates light and the fragrance of love. He is the friend of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The fire that creates light and warmth and is useful is of higher quality. The fire that creates light and a little smoke as well is of medium quality. The fire that creates darkness and only smoke is of low quality. Learn to distinguish the different fires. If your senses are engaged in goodness, then you will create light and fragrance. If engaged in impurity, you create smoke and darkness. It is <i>samyama</i> that transforms the quality of fire in you. Next week we will discuss <i>samyama</i>. </p>

  	    <b><p align="CENTER"><b>HABITS AND VOWS</b></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;How to get rid of <i>vasanas</i> (impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;You want to get rid of habits because they give pain and restrict you. The nature of <i>vasana</i> is to bother you, or bind you, and wanting to be free is the nature of life. Life wants to be free and when a soul doesn't know how to be free, it wanders through lifetimes wanting freedom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The way to come out of habits is vows. This is <i>samyama</i>. Everybody is endowed with a little <i>samyama</i>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;A vow should be time bound. This would bring good conduct and save you from being wayward. Consider the time and place for vows to be taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When the mind dwells on useless thoughts, then two things happen. One is that all those old patterns come up and you feel discouraged by them. You blame yourself and feel that you have not made any progress. </p>
<p>&nbsp;The second thing is that you see it as an opportunity for <i>samyama</i> and feel happy about it. Without <i>samyama,</i> life will not be happy and diseases arise. For example, you know you should not eat three servings of ice cream, or eat ice cream every day, or otherwise you will get sick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Habits will clog you when there is no liveliness or juice in life. When there is a direction for life force, you can rise above habits through <i>samyama.</i></p><i>
</i><p>&nbsp;Take vows according to time and place. For example, suppose someone has a habit of smoking cigarettes and says, "I will quit smoking," but cannot do it. They can take a vow, three months or 90 days; a time-bound vow. If someone is used to cursing and swearing, take a vow not to use bad language for ten days. Don't take it for a lifetime; you will break it immediately. If you happen to break it in between, don't worry. Just begin again. Slowly increase the duration until it becomes your nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;All those habits which bother you, bind them in vows, in <i>samyama</i>. So all those who are in Satsang, take a time-bound vow today and make a note of it. If you break a vow, make a note of it and share the time and date at the next Satsang. Continue it again. Tie those habits which bring you pain in <i>samyama</i>.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER"><b>DEALING WITH BLAME</b></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;When someone blames you, what do you usually do? Blame them back or you put up resistance in yourself. When someone blames you, they actually take away some negative karma from you. If you understand this and don't put up resistance and feel happy about it, then you drop your resistance. "Oh, good. That person is blaming me. Good. Something is going away." And when you drop the resistance, your karma goes away. Do you see what I'm saying? </p>
<p>&nbsp;So when someone blames you and you put up resistance in your mind, and you don't react, then you are not allowing them to take the negative karma. Outside you may resist, but inside if you don't resist, and feel happy, "Oh, good, somebody is there to blame me and take some negative karma," you will feel immediately lighter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;How does it feel to you when someone blames you? Do you feel some heaviness? Usually, when someone blames you, you feel hurt and you feel unhappy, you feel sad. This is all because you're . . . resisting. That is it. What you resist, persists. The ignorant person tells someone, "Don't blame me because it hurts me."</p>
<p>&nbsp;An enlightened person also says "Don't blame me." Do you know why? Because it might hurt you. This is a beautiful point. What are the points? You get hurt because you resist the blame. When someone blames you, you resist it inside. Outside you may not resist, but inside when you resist, then that hurts you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;An ignorant person warns you, "You better not hurt me, you better not blame me because I will feel hurt." Someone warns you not to blame them because it will hurt them and they'll do something harmful to you out of revenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;An enlightened person says "Don't blame me because it will hurt you." So here you say, don't blame because of compassion. You can tell someone, don't blame me out of compassion, or you can say it out of anger.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER"><b>TODAY IS KRISHNA'S BIRTHDAY</b></p>
<p align="CENTER">		BIRTH OF THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION</p>
</b><p>&nbsp;Krishna means the most attractive . . . It is the divinity that is the most attractive; the energy that pulls everything to it. Krishna is the formless center which is everywhere. Any attraction from anywhere is coming only from Krishna. Often people fail to see the spirit behind the attraction and merely hold on to the outer shell. And the moment you try to possess the shell, you will see Krishna has played a trick and you will be left with an empty shell in your hands and tears in your eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Be clever like Radha -- don't be tricked by Krishna. Krishna could not escape from Radha, for her whole world was filled with Krishna. If you can see that wherever there is an attraction, there is Krishna; then you are Radha, you are in your center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The mind moves towards beauty, joy and truth. Krishna tells Arjuna, "I am the beauty in the Beautiful, the strength in the Strong, the wisdom in the Wise." In this way he arrests the mind from moving away from him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Krishna reveals this Knowledge to Arjuna because he is <i>Anasuya</i>. Next week we will see what is <i>Anasuya</i>.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER"><b>ANASUYA</b></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;Knowledge will be different at different levels of consciousness. At a particular level of consciousness you will become <i>anasuya</i>. <i>Anasuya</i> is devoid of fault-finding eyes. If a mirror is dusty, you need a duster to clean it. But if your eyes have a cataract, any amount of dusting will not help. So first you have to remove the cataract. Then you can see that the mirror is already clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There is a certain mind set that always finds fault, even in the best conditions in the world. When you give a person with this mind set the best, they still find faults. Even with the best possible companion, or the most beautiful painting, they will still find something wrong. That kind of mind set cannot know the sacred Knowledge. Krishna tells Arjuna that he is giving him the Royal Secret, because he is <i>anasuya</i>. "You are not finding fault in Me, even though you are so close."</p>
<p>&nbsp;From a distance, even craters cannot be seen. Even on a smooth surface there will be holes. If you are only interested in the holes, you will not see the magnanimity of things. If you are not in <i>anasuya</i>, Knowledge cannot blossom in you. Then there is no point in giving Knowledge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Question: What about discrimination -- Wisdom?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Answer: If it is in your vision, your vision will find discrimination. The moment you are out of the path, everything is all wrong, that is not <i>anasuya</i>. For example, you have a friendship, and after 10 years you decide to leave. When you leave, you do not see the good in that relationship. You find fault. This is not <i>anasuya</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, once you discover you have the wrong vision, half of the wrong vision has already disappeared. There is a fine line here. There cannot be any better example than the cataract. Instead of saying, "My vision is blurred," you say, "The whole world is not sharp." Suppose someone is coming in. It is windy, so you shut the door. But the person thinks the door has been slammed in his face! This is <i>asuya</i>. It is not <i>anasuya</i>. Most of the population is like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>Asuya</i> is finding fault. It is seeing malicious intent everywhere. It is like a child who says, "Mother, you don't love me!" The child's vision is wrong. If the mother does not love the child, who will? It is the same as if someone comes and says, "Guruji, you don't love me!" If I don't love them, forget about it. Nobody else in the world will! Where else will they find love? Nowhere. A mother may get frustrated but not a Master.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Question: It seems as though you can't have <i>anasuya</i> unless you are enlightened?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Answer: Not always. This is an excuse. To get enlightenment, you must have this vision.</p>

  	    <b><p align="CENTER"><b>THE LOVE OF THE IGNORANT AND THE ANGER OF THE ENLIGHTENED</b></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;The love of the ignorant can be harmful yet even the anger of the Enlightened is not harmful. It can be only good!</p>
<p>&nbsp;An example is the school at the Art of Living Ashram in Bangalore. 250 children are enrolled but only 200 come to class on any given day. Fifty children don't show up. Why? They cry at home, "Mother, I don't want to go to school."</p>
<p>&nbsp;The mother says, "Oh, la la, don't cry . . . ok." She thinks, "No child in the world is like my child." And so she sticks up for the child and begins to speak for him. She does not see the teacher's point of view. The mother asks the teacher, "Why are you not teaching my child properly? He is so innocent, so lovely." So, what happens -- the child grows up spoiled. The love in the mother's ignorance has spoiled the child. The child will never learn the alphabet, never learn to read or write, but the mother says, "Oh, never mind, there are sheep to look after and fields to tend." The mother's love in ignorance has spoiled the child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The anger of the Enlightened is a blessing. There are many instances of this in the <i>Puranas</i>. Once a Master was traveling in the middle province of India with a disciple following him a few yards behind. Some boys who were rude, rough, and abusive began to throw stones and tease the disciple calling him names. This went on for some time as the boys followed the Master and the disciple. They came to a river. The Master and the disciple got into a boat in order to cross. The boys got in another boat which started to sink in the middle of the river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Master slapped the disciple across the face. The disciple was so surprised as he had not said a word back to the boys in response to their taunts. He had been such a good disciple and yet the Master had slapped him!</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Master said, "It is your fault. You are responsible for their boat sinking. You did not respond to their abuse. Nature has now punished them in a worse way because you did not have enough compassion to quell their insults."</p>
<p>&nbsp;The slap that the Master gave took away the karma of this event such that it would not be carried into the future of the boys. It also served to take away any little bit of joy the disciple may have felt at seeing the boys' boat sink! Thus, it also took away the karma of the event for the disciple. So, the anger of the Enlightened is a blessing!</p>

</b><p>&nbsp;Like fish in the water, you are in air. Thoughts are in mind. Mind is in Big Mind. The Big Mind in Me is love. Emotions are ripples in love. Love is all Knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Every atom of Big Mind is crammed with Knowledge. Knowing this, you stop seeking. You seek until you come to the Master. You walk until you come to the swimming pool.

<p>&nbsp;When you forget this you become sad. Sorrow indicates </p>

<p>&nbsp;Knowledge or awareness leads sorrow towards the self. With lack of Knowledge, the same sorrow multiplies and does not get completed. Knowledge completes sorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;With the power of Knowledge you transcend sorrow. In this path you have everything. We have this beautiful Knowledge which has all the flavors in it -- wisdom, laughter, <i>seva</i>, silence, singing, dancing, humor, celebration, <i>yagyas</i>, caring, complaints, problems, complications, and chaos to add color.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER"><b>FREEDOM AND DISCIPLINE</b></p>
</b><p>Freedom and discipline are opposites and complementary. The purpose of defense is to protect freedom. But is there freedom in defense? Do soldiers have freedom? No, they are totally bound, not even allowed to put the right foot down when told the left foot. Their steps are measured and they are unable even to walk with a natural rhythm. There is total lack of freedom in defense. That which has absolutely no freedom is protecting the freedom of the country! So it is with the police; they protect the freedom of the individual. But are they free?</p>
<p>Discipline protects freedom. They both go hand in hand. Understand this and go ahead in life. You have some restrictions and it is this that allows you freedom. You can choose to focus either on freedom or discipline, and this makes you happy or unhappy. Freedom without discipline is like a country without a defense.</p>
<p>Fences should be fences; a fence cannot be built all over the property. If your fence is all over, how can you build on the property? That state of high absolute freedom is too difficult; we need to be very practical. Yes, there is a state of unlimited bliss, the freedom Advaita talks about. The Advaita Knowledge has been totally misused or used according to one's own fancies and conveniences.</p>
<p>There must be awareness in the mind, love in the heart, and righteousness in action.</p>
<p>Love and fear are two possibilities that put you on track. The Jewish religion put fear as the main thing so that life could improve. Nature induces fear at a certain age in a child. When a child is very young, it gets 100 percent time and love of the mother. The child has no fear. As the child grows more independent it becomes cautious. Nature brings in an iota of fear. With freedom, the child starts walking carefully. Fear of losing freedom also brings defense. The purpose of defense is to eliminate fear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Once you cross the water, however nice the boat is, you get off the boat. After twelve years, the disciple completes his studies. The master does a ceremony called <i>Samavartha</i>, where he tells the disciple that he is ending the discipleship and asking him to behave at par with him, and let the <i>Brahman</i> dynamically manifest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>Sakha</i> is a companion in life and death; it never ends. In the path of love there is neither beginning nor end. <i>Sakha</i> only wants the beloved. He doesn't care about the Knowledge or liberation. Love is incomplete because of longing. And so it is infinite, for infinity can never be complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Arjuna was a <i>sakha</i> to Krishna and although Krishna was the perfect Master he was a <i>sakha,</i> too. What are you, a <i>shishya</i> (disciple) or a <i>sakha</i> (companion)?</p>

</b><p>&nbsp;There are three things: the Self, the senses, and the object, or the world. And there are three words: <i>sukha</i>, pleasure; <i>dukha</i>, sorrow; and <i>sakha</i>, companion. These have one thing in common: "kha," which means "senses."</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Self through the senses experiences the world. When the senses are with the Self, that is pleasure (<i>sukha</i>), because the Self is the source of all joy or pleasure. When the senses are away from the Self (<i>dukha</i>) -- in the mud, lost in the object -- that is misery. Mud, misery, mind -- they are very close.</p>
</font><font face="BernhardMod BT" size="5"><p>Self &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senses ("Kha")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World</p>
<p>---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy (Sukha)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorrow (Dukha)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--- </p>
</font><font face="BernhardMod BT"><p>Self is the nature of joy. In any pleasant experience, you close your eyes; you smell a nice flower, or you taste or touch something. So<i> sukha</i> is that which takes you to the Self. <i>Dukha</i> is that which takes you away from the Self. Sorrow simply means that you are caught up in the object, which goes on changing, instead of focussing on the Self.</p>
<p>All the sense objects are just a diving board to take you back to the Self.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Sa-kha</i>, companion, means: "He <b><i>is</i></b> the senses." <i>Sakha</i> is one who has become your senses, who is your senses. If you are my senses, it means I get Knowledge through you; you are my sixth sense. As I trust my mind, so I trust you. A friend could be just an object of the senses, but a <i>sakha</i> has become the very senses.</p>
<p>The <i>sakha</i> is the companion who is there in both the experiences of the <i>dukha</i> and of <i>sukha</i>. It means one who leads you back to the Self. If you are stuck in an object, that wisdom which pulls you back to the Self is <i>sakha</i>.</p>
<p>Knowledge is your companion and your companion is Knowledge. And the Master is nothing but the embodiment of Knowledge. So<i> sakha</i> means, "He is my senses, I see the world through that wisdom, through Him."</p>
<p>If your sense is the Divine, then you see the whole world through the Divinity.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER"><b>SCEPTICISM</b></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;Ignorance is being a sceptic and not knowing you are a sceptic. If you think you are a sceptic, you are no longer a sceptic because you have a clue of something beyond. So, in reality, you can never know whether you are a sceptic or not!</p>
<p>&nbsp;A sceptic is stuck in a paradigm and closes all other possibilities. But this creation is of all possibilities. As one understands the paradigm shift, scepticism is removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A real scientist can never afford to be a sceptic because scepticism closes down possibilities and does not continue to probe into unknown areas of existence. </p>
<p>&nbsp;In short, scepticism is an "I know it all" attitude, and this attitude is unscientific. Scepticism is dispelled by Knowledge. Perception and inference are two means of knowing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In every human being deep inside, there is faith and love. What you think is scepticism is only a thin layer. If you hold in your mind that they are sceptics you empower their scepticism. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Do not recognize someone's scepticism and try to argue with them. Argument strengthens their scepticism. Fear of interference in one's freedom brings more resistance and causes scepticism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Your silence and the smile from your heart will dispel their scepticism. There is nothing better than silence to break scepticism. Silence means the quality of consciousness, not just keeping lips tight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Scepticism doesn't come up in children. It comes only with people who walk with boundaries. Children have no scepticism. They live in their fantasy world, a world of many possibilities. Their world is one of innocence, joy, beauty, and so much love.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER"><b>SHAUCHA AND ASHAUCHA</b></p>
</b><p>&nbsp;When you are miserable, what has happened is that you have gone away from the Self. This is called <i>Ashaucha</i>. It means you have become unclean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In India when someone dies, the close relatives are said to be <i>Ashaucha</i> for 10 days because they are very sad. They are impure because they have moved away from the self. After 10 days of just being with that experience and reading the Gita, being with the Knowledge and pulling themselves back into the Self, then it is called <i>Shaucha</i>. They have purged out the impurities that have come during events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This keeps happening again and again in dealings in life. You become <i>Ashaucha</i> and you have to get back to<i> Shaucha</i>. Go deeper in to yourself, then real <i>Shaucha</i> happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>Shaucha's</i> benefits are clarity in the intellect, a pleasing mind, focused awareness in the mind, a say over the senses, and therefore eligibility to realize the Self.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>Shaucha</i> is disinterestedness in the tendencies of one's own senses and non-association with other people. If a tendency in your body arises just have the understanding, "Oh yes, here is this old familiar tendency coming up again. Come on, you have had this experience enough, and still the body is craving for it again." Disinterestedness in one's own body -- just an idea, a sort of distaste, and in one moment it changes.</p>
<p>Why do people love each other so much, have such an intimate relationship, and then fight? <i>Ashaucha</i> has happened. If you don't get distaste for the tendency of the senses then distaste for the object of the senses will come and you will blame the object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When <i>Ashaucha</i> happens then come back to <i>Shaucha</i> quickly. Suppose you get drowned in any worldly aspect, just know this is <i>Ashaucha</i> . . . "That is why I am suffering misery." Then come back to <i>Shaucha</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Your attraction or craving is only as long as you think someone is "other." When you think they are part of you or your Self, then the attraction dies out. That is why a husband or wife is not attracted to the partner but to someone else because the partner has already become a part of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When you realize everyone is part of your Self, you enjoy the whole world without a sense of craving.</p>

<p>&nbsp;A repetition without interest or love causes a monotonous state of mind; that is boredom. It overshadows the Self. </p>
<p>&nbsp;A practice or <i>abhyasa</i> is again a repetition whose purpose is to destroy the boredom and reunite with the Self. In this process the practice itself creates boredom and as you continue, it penetrates the boredom and destroys it once and for all. Whether the practice gives you joy or boredom, it must be continued. Only the practice or <i>abhyasa</i> can annihilate the Mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Self is Love and Love is always repetitive. That is why love letters are simply repetitive and there is no boredom there. If you are bored with yourself then how much more boring you would be for others. Root out the boredom in you through deep and continued meditation.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">WHO ARE YOU? BRAHMA, VISHNU, MAHESH OR GURU?</p></b>
<p>&nbsp;There are three forces: <i>Brahma shakti, Vishnu shakti, </i>and <i>Shiva shakti</i>. You may have one of these predominant. <i>Brahma shakti</i> is the force to create something new. <i>Vishnu shakti</i> is maintenance and <i>Shiva shakti</i> is bringing in transformation, filling in life, or destroying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Some of you have <i>Brahma shakti</i>. You may create well, but you may not be able to maintain. For example, you may make friends very fast, but it does not last long. </p>
<p>&nbsp;There are others who cannot create but are good at maintaining. For example, people have long lasting friendships but cannot make any new friends. In such cases, <i>Vishnu shakti</i> is dominant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;And then there are others who have more of <i>Shiva shakti</i>. They bring in new life or transformation or they can destroy the whole set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In <i>Guru shakti</i>, all three <i>shaktis</i> have blossomed fully. </p>
<p>&nbsp;So each of you first identify which <i>shakti</i> you have more of and aspire for <i>Guru shakti</i>. Guru makes a group but a group cannot make a Guru.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">HOW TO MAINTAIN INTIMACY</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;Intimacy often gets broken because of ego or your desire. What breaks intimacy?</p>

<dir>

<p>	Ego or taking a position</p>
<p>	Desire</p>
<p>	Taking intimacy for granted</p>
<p>	Finding imperfection in oneself or others</p>
<p>	Expectations</p>
<p>	Insensitivity or over sensitivity</p>
<p>	Lack of vivek or vairagya (lack of discretion or dispassion)</p>
<p>	Judgements</p>
<p>	Grumbling or lack of gratitude</p></dir>


<p>Dissolving into infinity is the way to maintain intimacy. Intimacy is dissolving into infinity. Dissolving into infinity brings you to the moment. Go beyond events. Dissolve into infinity, be in the moment, and look beyond the events. This is the way to maintain intimacy.</p>
<p align="CENTER">* * * * </p>
<p>If you attend Satsang you don't get much; but if you don't, you lose a lot. Just to maintain where you are, what you are, you need to attend weekly Satsang. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Now, start doing ten minutes of Satsang, sharing of the Knowledge with someone, anyone. You are so used to talking gossip. Now for two weeks, talk Knowledge, especially to those not coming to Satsang. Even on the phone -- suppose you can't find someone at seven o'clock; call someone on the phone and talk Knowledge for a couple of minutes: "What are you doing? What do you want? How can I help you?" Praise the Divine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is an exercise. Every day for ten minutes, do individual Satsang and skillfully talk ten minutes of Knowledge. Say, "Everything is temporary, everything is changing." Speak some Knowledge on the changing nature of the world.</p>

<p>Guruji was on the porch with a group of people. He sent Kashi to get the sweets from inside the kuti, but Kashi returned saying he could not find them.

<p>&nbsp;This is exactly what happens in life. Many want sweetness in life. Some are searching hard, but only one finds it. And when that one finds it, he gives it to everyone.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">OVERCOMING EVENTS</p>
</b><p>&nbsp;All the problems that you face in life are because you attach over importance to the events. The events grow bigger while you remain smaller. Say, for example, you are riding a motorbike on a busy motor way and in front of you there is another vehicle emitting exhaust fumes. You have three options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><dir>
<dir>

<p>1. 	You can complain, somehow bear with it, and still follow the vehicle.</p>
<p>2. 	You can slow down or wait for some time to allow the vehicle to move far away from you.</p>
<p>3. 	You can use your skill, overtake the vehicle, and forget about it.</p></dir>
</dir>

<p>As in the first case, most of you stick on the events and are miserable, like inhaling fumes throughout your journey.</p>
<p>In the second case, you don't get permanent relief, as another bigger vehicle might come in front of you. Like that, running away from events is not the permanent solution.</p>
<p>However, wise people use their skill and grow over the events. If the vehicle is in perfect condition, the skill is effective. Conditioning the vehicle is <i>sadhana</i> or practice. And skill is the grace of the Guru.</p>
<p>The mistakes that you have made in the past have made you humble; you need not make mistakes in the future to become humble.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">SPREADING THE FRAGRANCE</p>
</b><p>&nbsp;During Satsang, Guruji opened a small nicely-wrapped present. It was a tiny bottle of jasmine perfume. He twisted off the cap and sniffed the lovely fragrance. Then he proceeded to pour a small amount on some paper which he waved in the air, wafting the scent to all corners of the hall. Everyone could then enjoy it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Guruji explained that it is not enough simply to have the fragrance. We have to know how to spread it. Flowers have the fragrance, but it is the wind that comes and spreads it. In the same way, each one of us is wonderful within -- we are beautiful, caring, and loving. But we do not know how to spread the fragrance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Satsang is that wind which comes and spreads this fragrance to everyone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b>NEWS FLASH</b></p><b>
</b><p>&nbsp;Guruji arrived for the first time on January 15th in the Croatian capital of Zagreb. As soon as we landed, Guruji was driven straight to one of the largest concert halls in Zagreb. Guruji first met with a group of over a hundred professionals including doctors and members of the press. A few hours later the hall was filled to capacity for his evening lecture. The national television station filmed the entire talk. Over 100 people waited outside unable to enter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Before addressing the large crowd Guruji went out to the lobby and greeted those who could not enter. His talk was exquisite and a soft feeling of grace and peace transformed the atmosphere. At the end of the lecture many still waited outside for over two hours to get a glimpse of Guruji.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The next evening Guruji gave his first talk in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Hundreds crowded into the World Trade Center. Guruji was soon overloaded with flowers from the group. Guruji continued to talk for an hour and a half as the enthusiastic crowd would not let him finish. The atmosphere was charged with immense gratitude and celebration. The Art of Living groups in Croatia and Slovenia have done an excellent job.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">ADVICE FROM HAWAII</p>
</b><p>&nbsp;What type of time do you give the Divine? Usually you give the time that is leftover, when you have nothing else to do, when no guests are coming, there are no parties to go to, no nice movies to watch, no weddings to attend. Such time you give. This is not quality time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Give quality time to the Divine. It will be rewarded. If your prayers are not answered it is because you have never given quality time. Give Satsang and meditation your highest priority. Give prime time to the Divine. You definitely will be rewarded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="CENTER">* * * * </p>
<p>&nbsp;Here in Hawaii there is a fun-filled course, for you know <i>God Loves Fun</i>. This has been followed with the long-awaited book, <i>Way of Grace</i>. Satsang is open to the public each evening. The huge waves of the Hawaiian shores cannot compete with the waves of bliss at Satsang. Guruji has brought out deep Knowledge from the most mundane questions. We are making efforts to bring these tapes to you soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="CENTER">* * * * </p>
<p>What is most freely given yet not taken?</p><dir>
<dir>

<p>1.	Compliments? . . . no.</p>
<p>2.	Blame? . . . no, people take blame.</p>
<p>3.	Money? . . . no, money is readily taken, not freely given.</p>
<p>4.	Happiness? . . . nobody can give happiness.</p>
<p>5. 	??</p></dir>
</dir>

<p>The clue is that it hangs in space like an orphan. No one owns it. Like an overripe papaya in Hawaii, it rots.</p>
<p>The answer to this riddle lies in the beginning.</p>
<p>ALOHA!</p>

<p>&nbsp;A lady was driving along the coast of Kauai and just started singing our Bhajans which she had never heard before. Later she found herself at our Satsang.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A Hawaiian Princess, Owana, found herself wondering why she felt compelled to drive in circles around a hotel in Honolulu. Later she found out from a devotee that it was Guruji's hotel. The next night she was singing her deeply felt native Hawaiian songs at Punditji's feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;On Sunday, a lady named Mary was spending the day at an ancient temple ruins. She had gone there to make an offering and to pray. Her prayer was to meet her spiritual teacher and be shown the way Home. On Monday, she met Punditji and instantly became devoted. </p>

</b><p>&nbsp;Question: God is all abundant, all full and we are connected to God. Then why are we in debt, except for some? Why do they have, and we don't have?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Guruji: Is it only money? You have abundance, yet at the same time, you are indebted. So how can both be true? How can you be indebted and at the same time have abundance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Somebody says: An abundance of indebtedness!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Guruji: When you say you are indebted, that means you have received. Otherwise how can you be indebted? So be thankful for being indebted, because you have received. Those who have received should feel indebted. If you don't feel indebted, you cannot have abundance. So the more indebted you feel, the more abundance you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Question: When the disciples met Jesus, they were not very successful, did not catch very many fish. When they met Jesus, he told them exactly where to fish and that's when they got lots of fish and then they decided to follow Jesus. </p>
<p>&nbsp;(Laughter)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Guruji: Feel indebted. Feel gratitude. Then abundance comes. As long as you are wanting for abundance you get indebted. Feel indebtedness and gratitude, then abundance comes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Abundance and indebtedness coexist. You think you are indebted, but you really are not. It is better to feel totally indebted, because every bit of what you have, doesn't belong to you, including your body. Then you are infinitely indebted for your body, for Knowledge, for things you have received, and for your own life. Then you bask in the abundance of the Creator.</p>

<p>&nbsp;From there -- unbelievable Satsangs in packed halls in Los Angeles. The drummers and Divya got everyone on their feet. The atmosphere was electrifying. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Guruji went to the University of Northeast Missouri that had sponsored his visit. Students and Lloyd had organized 700 people to welcome Guruji.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guruji, not only in spirit, but also physically, piloted a twin engine Cessna plane back to St. Louis, Missouri on his way to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The church was filled with devotion and decorations. The way Guruji looked -- the Grace and Knowledge were so magical -- the scene is impossible to describe. The hurricane of<i> Satva </i>has moved on to Miami. </p>

</b><p>&nbsp;Just a week before Guruji's arrival, Raj woke up in the middle of the night in Loughborough. He thought that some light was coming from the clock. He looked at Guruji's picture and saw that light was coming from it. This light grew and filled the room. He made sure that there was no outside light left on. The divine light stayed on for about ten minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Upholland, Lancashire held an advanced course in Guruji's presence.</p>
<p>Guruji gave a talk on Ayurveda and the Art of Living at the Liverpool Medical Institution. The hall was full to capacity with standing room only, attended by medical professionals. It was a brilliant talk, but Punditji did not think so! He thought it was very mundane! There was great enthusiasm, however.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Next, Guruji's entourage moved with luggage and cars at its own speed and proceeded to Stourbridge in the Midlands for a talk organized by Stourbridge Earth Mysteries. The talk was simply great! The entourage then moved on to London, arriving at 3 o' clock in the morning for "The UK Tired of Living Teacher's Meeting" with baggage, blankets, pillows, plastic bags, pots and pans, and the usual divine chaos!!</p>

</b><p>&nbsp;In science you have knowledge first, and then faith follows.</p>
<p>In spirituality, faith comes first, and then Knowledge follows.</p>
<p>For example, the knowledge that pesticides and chemical fertilizers are good for plants came through science, and people had faith in it, and all over the world they were used. And then another knowledge came that they were not good and the faith shifted to organic farming. The same with antibiotics. </p>
<p>The knowledge brought faith, the knowledge changed, and then faith changed. The knowledge and faith of science is of "happening." In spirituality, faith is first and Knowledge comes later. Like Kriya, Yoga, and meditation -- first you have faith and then Knowledge follows. For example, if you do pranayama faithfully then you get the Knowledge of the prana; if your do your meditation faithfully, the Knowledge of consciousness follows. Even an illiterate, through faith, attains deep Knowledge.</p>
<p>Vinod: Human is the best composite material. (Laughter -- this is the NASA scientist mind.)</p>

<p>Then the giggling gang moved on to Norway, but had left some luggage behind in the hotel. The flight was conveniently delayed, which was very unusual for SAS. Lakshmi had called Guruji the night before. Guruji had said we will arrive at the airport at exactly 12:15. It kept Lakshmi wondering and confused because it was almost one hour later than the original arrival time. And they all arrived on the dot at 12:15!</p>

<p>&nbsp;Another programme entitled "The Three Wise Men" was made with one of Sweden's most respected TV journalists for a major TV channel. The three wise men included Guruji and the Dalai Lama.</p>

  		<b></b><p><b>NEWS FLASH</b> </p>
<p>Before Guruji arrived in Delhi, everything was meticulously planned and organized. When Guruji arrived, there was a spontaneous Satsang at the airport. Airport personnel and other passengers joined in. It was sparkling! The well-organized plans went haywire and the usual divine chaos followed. Everything was settled in a flash but the organizers were left holding the plans on paper!</p>
<p>There was an air of celebration at Saritha Vihar Satsang. The sweets and flowers made a carpet in the large hall that matched the fragrance of joy. At Karol Bagh, the next day, there was more than one reason for the authorities to raise their eyebrows -- stampede in the room, traffic jam on roads, and devotees forgetting their families in their eagerness to follow the "Gurumobile." Then on to Rishikesh and the teachers' refresher course. </p>
<p>Rishikesh. The lush green Himalayas all around -- in the front, the holy Ganges that roars, gurgles, and sometimes murmurs -- the sounds mingling with the chirping of the birds -- the call of the peacocks in the early morning -- the chiming of the temple bells at sunrise -- the chanting of Vedic hymns at all times. Dip in the cold waters -- everyone clad in shawls and sweaters on their way in -- and most reluctant to leave afterwards. Sitting with Guruji in the evening, watching the sunset. Electrifying Satsangs and discourses on Bhagwad Gita in Hindi by Guruji, transport everyone to a blissful, celestial experience. More about Rishikesh next week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Guruji is still in Rishikesh. 350 people arrived from all over India for the advanced course -- a hundred more than expected. The volunteers had to run around trying to arrange rooms in the ashrams. During Satsang, the hall was spilling over with participants whose faces radiated ecstasy in the presence of the Master. </p>
<p>&nbsp;It appeared that all the Gods from heaven came down to earth to the holy town of Rishikesh to bask in the glory of the Master. The powerful Himalayas and the divine Ganges echo the sounds of joy and the laughter of the devotees. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Today is Gudi Padwa and Ugadi --- the new year celebrated in many parts of India. All 350 devotees went for a dip in the holy Ganges at 4:30 a.m. with Guruji oblivious to the temperature of the river. This was a new start to the new year in the presence of the Divine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;The most renowned, 75-year old saint of Rishikesh, Swami Pragyanandji had a vision in which he saw Guruji as Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh with many arms. He then performed a puja to Guruji.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">BLAMING AND MISERY</p>
</b><p>When a worldly man is miserable, he blames the people around him, the system, and the world in general. </p>
<p>When a seeker is miserable he, of course, blames the world, but in addition he blames the path, the Knowledge, and himself. </p>
<p>It is better not to be a seeker so that you blame less. But then a seeker (<i>sadhak</i>) also enjoys everything much more. There is more love in life and more pain. When there is more joy, the contrast is greater. A certain level of maturity is needed to see things as they are and not to blame the path, the self, and the world. Do you see what I am saying?</p>
<p>It is like a quantum leap. If one jumps across this threshold then there is no fall.</p>
<p>The Divine does not test you. Testing is part of ignorance. </p>
<p>Who will test? One who does not know will test, isn't it? God knows your capacity, so why does he have to test you? Then, why the misery? It is <i>thithiksha</i>, or forbearance, in you. And forbearance could be increased by prayerful surrender or vigorous challenge for patience! (Laughter)</p>

<p>&nbsp;Picnic to Neelkant hills and holy Haridwar was a grand finale to the Rishikesh course, followed by a wild Satsang in New Delhi. It was so charged! Guruji is back in the Ashram for a quiet three days before his Australian tour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;From U.K.: Guruji had given a rose to a lady on February 13 and they called to say that the flower was still amazingly fresh and fragrant after six weeks! This miracle inspired an otherwise unwilling lady to do the course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Important exercise: Find out what it is that has been with you forever. Belma says that she asked herself this question 20 years ago and she knows all the answers. And that there is only one answer . . . . (Laughter)</p>

<p>When someone is drowning in the ocean of attachments, surrender is the life jacket they can put on and wait for the rescue team. Without fighting the attachments, observe the feverish breath and go to the cool place of silence within.

<p>&nbsp;Like that, the word "disillusionment." It is good that you are disillusioned. You have come to reality. Like <i>purana.</i> It means "that which is new in the town, the most modern." But it is used in the sense of being old. In the course of time, meanings of words change. The word "enthused" comes from the Greek which means "God is with us." Then it came to mean crazy, and now it's changed again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Don't be stuck with the words. Your worries are words. Your ideas are words. Wisdom is beyond words. It is the very Being. It is the essence of all words. See and relate beyond words. Then there is no lie in your life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The skies opened and grace poured down in buckets at the Ashram this week. It was a confluence of eight prominent saints of India who in a private meeting honored Guruji in one of their ashrams. Each of these saints gives lectures or Darshan to hundreds of thousands of devotees and they all run their own schools, hospitals and ashrams. Four of them who were just introduced to Guruji followed us for a brief tour of our Ashram.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When they were all at Sumeru Mantap, lightening and thunder surrounded us and everyone was drenched and then they ran to Guruji's kutir. Immediately these very popular and formal Sanyasis began to shed their orange garments. But what to give them to wear? Guruji gave them all white dhotis. Soon they were all wearing our Guruji's white dhotis and being fed by his hand looking more and more like a group of joyful children happy to be home again. Somehow in their "new clothes" they began to relax and smile and laugh and soon the grace of our Guru had them radiating from deep inside. </p>
<p>&nbsp;All of us were shocked to see how the formal heads of institutions were transformed and by the time they were leaving, they humbly asked for Guruji's blessings and invited him to their ashrams and to lead them in meditation. They said, "Mother Nature gave us all a bath before entering your temple, Guruji." We stood and watched this event with awe and laughter.</p>

</b><p>Illusion is error of perception and knowing illusion as illusion is Knowledge. Our experience of the world is based on perception. Since every perception is erroneous, the world is an illusion. Experiences are all of perception. The experiencer is the only reality. Look for the seer, the experiencer, in between experiences. Every experience leaves a hangover and clouds the intellect. Wake up this moment. Shake your head of all past experiences and look at the pure Being that I am and that you are.</p>
<p>Question: How do you distinguish the experience and the experiencer?</p>
<p>Answer: Are you really all here? Are you listening? Now close your eyes and see who is listening, who is questioning, who is sitting, and who wants what? Who is confused? You may not get any answer but that is fine. Never mind.</p> 		</font>

<p>&nbsp;Chinese movie maker tried his level best to sign up Guruji for his latest block buster. Guruji said, "I don't know acting," and the movie maker said, "Just be natural, accept the situation as it is, take responsibility, be 100%." The movie is about a wise man who brought Buddhism to China. The movie maker said that through this mega performance, the Art of Living would reach the whole of China. Guruji winked at his devotees and said, "Should I change my profession?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;The first advanced course ended and the second has begun. The Ashram is bustling with people. Every inch of space is occupied -- three times the holding capacity of the Ashram and yet no complaints. No chaos! So smooth! Only laughter and new songs have filled Sumeru Mantap.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">SEVA IS SAVIOR</p>
</b><p>&nbsp;The way to expand from individual to universal consciousness is to share others's&nbsp;sorrow and joy. As you grow, your consciousness should also grow. When you expand in Knowledge with time, then depression is not possible. Your inner most source is joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The way to overcome personal misery is to share universal misery! The way to expand personal joy is to share universal joy. Instead of thinking "what about me?" "what can I gain from this world?" think "what can I do for the world?" When everyone comes from the point of contributing to society, you have a Divine society. We have to educate and culture our individual consciousness in order to expand in time with the Knowledge . . . from "what about me?" to "what can I contribute?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are not having good experiences in meditation, then do more seva -- you will gain merit and your meditation will be deeper. When you bring some relief or freedom to someone through seva, good vibrations and blessings come to you. Seva brings merit; merit allows you to go deep in meditation; meditation brings back your smile.</p>

The next day he came to Satsang and to the astonishment of the doctors, the man had been healed even though the MRI had shown a tear and a growth on the shoulder cuff. As the man told his story and presented a dozen red roses to Guruji, tears of gratitude rolled down everyone's cheeks. There were many reported healing experiences in St. Louis and Chicago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Chicago organizers said, "Here comes the Art of Living circus to town." (Laughter) There was an air of celebration as the devotees from the U.S. Midwest gathered with non-stop giggling and laughter. People were driving in circles, forgetting traffic rules, not sleeping, and laughing as Guruji (our sit-down comedian) amazed everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We rushed on to Portland. Dean says we have become Rushins instead of American, Indians, and Canadians. At The Old Church, there was not even standing space. The sight of Guruji put smiles on every face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Vancouver, the Aboriginal People warmly hosted Guruji at the University of British Columbia. The sky, the sea, the snow-capped mountains, the tall trees and the waterfalls all beckoned for the Knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sudarshana left the room for five minutes and returned asking, "What did I miss?" Marcy said, "Enlightenment!" (Laughter)</p>

  	    <b><p align="CENTER">JUDGEMENTS AND GOOD COMPANY</p>
</b><p>Though you have heard "don't judge," judgement comes unavoidably in day-to-day life. By the actions and behaviors of people, you either approve or disapprove. But always remember that everything is changing, and do not hold onto the judgement. Otherwise your judgement gets solidified like a rock. It brings misery for you and for others.</p>
<p>If judgements are lighter like air, like a breeze, they bring in fragrance, then move away. They could bring a foul smell, then move away. They should not stay there forever.</p>
<p>Judgements are so subtle that you are not even aware of their existence. Judging or labeling someone as judgmental is also a judgement. Only in the state of Being when you are full of love and compassion can you ever be free from all judgements.</p>
<p>Yet the world cannot move without judgements. Until you judge something as good or bad, you cannot do any actions. If you see rotten apples in the market, you say, "No good." Good ones you buy. If someone lies to you ten times, you think next time it also could be a lie. A judgment happens automatically.</p>
<p>See the possibility that people and things can change at any time and don't hold onto the judgements.</p>
<p>You need to judge your company. Your company can pull you up or pull you down. The company that drags you towards doubt, dejection, blame, complaints, anger, delusion, and desires is bad company. The company that pulls you up towards joy, enthusiasm, service, love, trust, and Knowledge is good company.</p>
<p>When someone complains, first you listen, then you nod, then you sympathize, then you complain.</p>
<p>Robert says, "Join the party." Denise says, "I confess, you are absolutely right." (Laughter)</p>

<p>Thanks to Janice, the Ayurvedic Course at the Ashram was a great success. The celebration continues in Montreal . . .</p>

  		<p>&nbsp;<b>NEWS FLASH</b>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;We emerged from silence to celebrate at the lake the fifth anniversary of the Ashram. It was like a fairytale with the full moon rising above the trees, the sounds of Susannah's and Phillip's flutes, fireworks, and bonfires. The Guru took us spinning in circles on a raft and to our surprise brought us back to the same shore. In the confusion, we forgot to serve the anniversary cake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;After the Montreal talk, Denise drove off with Guruji in the car with all the doors open. Ramola ran from behind and jumped in. In the fever to get into the Guru's car, somebody left luggage behind, another left a purse, another left their shoes, and they all left their minds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Guruji and Phillip have just left for Toronto and then are to go to Colorado.</p>
<p>&nbsp;On the 14th of July an Interfaith Prayer and Meditation Conference will be sponsored by the Art of Living in Washington DC. Ten Swamis from India have been invited. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Thomas called Punditji to tell him that a forest fire raging at Lake Tahoe which burned many million dollar houses, came up to his property, burned his tool shed, but stopped at his front door. Neither his home -- where many Satsangs had been held -- nor his garden were damaged.</p>

  	    <b><p align="CENTER">SURRENDER AND RESPONSIBILITY</p>
</b><p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up a time-bound goal gives direction to the life force. Imagination is essential for this. Most people have a small imagination and are stuck with that, and that causes frustration. But if you are a devotee, you say "Let Thy Will be done" and then you will step lightly to the goal. You will take it easy. We have to make a distinction. Some people say "Let God do everything and surrender" and others say "I have to be responsible."</p>
<p>Surrender is saying "Let Thy Will be done" and "Thy Will" for you is to take responsibility for the whole world.</p>
<p>It appears to be opposing and conflicting in nature -- in fact they are two sides of the same coin. The more you surrender, the more responsive you become. One who is irresponsible cannot surrender either. Why is someone irresponsible? They are lazy or fearful or both. If you are lazy or fearful, you cannot be in love.</p>
<p>Total responsibility is total surrender. It's a little hard to chew, but this is the truth. People usually say either I take responsibility or surrender, but I tell you they go hand in hand. Suppose you are surrendered to the Knowledge. That means you are committed to sharing it with others. You take responsibility to see that it flourishes.</p>
<p>Question: The confusion comes with the doership?</p>
<p>Answer: When you are taking responsibility and you find blocks, remember "surrender." That gives you strength to move ahead. It releases you from the weight of the doership. Responsibility is the dynamic expression of life in the present moment. When you are shaken, remember the basis of responsibility as surrender.</p>
<p>Taking responsibility or surrendering without doership is the skill of the wise. Total irresponsibility is impossible for you. Limited responsibility makes you weak. A little water in the sun will evaporate but the ocean never dries up. Limited responsibility tires you out. Unlimited responsibility empowers you and brings you joy.</p> 		</font>

<p>&nbsp;The fireworks arrived July 4th with Guruji at Colorado's largest advanced and basic courses ever. The hall was dressed with red, white, and blue balloons and ribbons in celebration of Independence (of the United States and our spirits). As we watched the explosions spread across the horizon, Guruji said, "That looks just like your minds." Guruji took a hike in the mountains and then met an enthusiastic crowd in Colorado Springs before flying on to California. There was a Satsang in Anu and N.J.'s home in Apple Valley for over 150 devotees before the Art of Living entourage moved on to northern California. There have been non-stop talks and Satsangs celebrating Guruji's summer tour to the U.S.</p>

<p>The Interfaith Prayer and Meditation Conference was wonderful and dramatic. Suzannah opened the Conference with her beautiful Hallelujah Bhajan and was joined by everyone. Children sang traditional devotional songs, and delegates from many faiths lit candles, offered deeply felt prayers, sang sweet hymns and led us in meditation. Represented were the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Bahai's, Buddhism, Church of Christ, Islam, Sufism, the Unity Church, Free Masonry, Hinduism, Presbyterian and Sikh, among others. An African holy man swathed in flowing white robes bowed before each delegate and the audience. </p>
<p>The nine Swamis from India, in their golden robes, dramatically entered the auditorium during the program and gave their blessings to Guruji. Guruji, sitting in the center of them all, provided the closing meditation. John was master of ceremonies and did a wonderful job staying centered amidst the chaos of program changes that nobody even noticed!</p>
<p>The Satsang that evening in the local Hindu Temple was sweet and full of lively spiritual energy. Guruji in white, sitting on the stage surrounded by the golden robed Swamis was a beautiful sight!</p>

  	    <b><p align="CENTER">DOING VERSUS HAPPENING</p></b>

<p>Only one who is 100 percent in doing can recognize the happening.</p>
<p>The healthiest way to apply this knowledge is to see the whole past as happening and the present as doing. If you see the past as doing, then ego and regret come along. And when you see the present as happening, then laziness and unawareness set in. If you apply the doing for the future, it brings tension and worry. If you apply the happening for the future, it might bring some confidence and also lethargy.</p>
<p>Let the happening be for the past. Let the doing be for the present. And the future is a mix of both.</p>
<p>The wise will see the doing in happening and the happening in doing simultaneously. Are you confused now? (Laughter)</p>
<p>One who does a lot of work will never say he did a lot. When someone says he did a lot of work, that means he can do more. He has not done enough. </p>
<p>Work does not tire you as much as the doership does. All the talents you have are for others. If you have good voice, it is for others. If you are a good cook, it is for others. If you write a good book, it is for others. What do you do? You donҴ sit and read your own book! If you are a good carpenter, it is for others. So all of your talents are useful for others. If you are a good surgeon, it is for others. You cannot do your own surgery. This is interesting. If you are school teacher, it is for others. You cannot teach your own children; they donҴ listen to you anyway. So all your work and talents are for others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Guruji: How many of you are grateful here? (<i>Everybody raises their hand</i>.) If you are grateful, you don't belong to Me! (<i>Everyone is shocked</i>.) You are not part of the Master. When someone gives you something, you are grateful. That means you feel separate. You are not grateful to yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Gratefulness is inevitable. When you go beyond gratefulness, then union happens. No "I," no "you" remains. You are part of the Master. You are just One Being with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, but with one heart. You have got to be grateful on the path, but you have to transcend gratefulness. Better stop being grateful. (<i>Laughter.</i>) </p>
<p>&nbsp;When you are grateful then <i>you</i> are the center, <i>you</i> are more important. When you are grateful to God for having received something beautiful, for example, eyesight, who is important? You or God? You! So your gratitude indicates ego.</p>

<p>Guruji arrived at the Washington airport and drove to three Satsangs and had dinner, then dinner, then dinner. Next day Bhanu shopped from 10 am to 5 pm.</p>
<p>Bhanu says, "Don't write that!"</p>
<p>Dr. Ganesh Prabhu, one of the leading cardiovascular surgeons, formerly of Johns Hopkins Hospital, asked if he could sit and meditate alone with Guruji without anyone else around. The deal was struck. Dr. Prabhu used a holter monitor on Guruji to measure the heart function while he was meditating. Afterwards Guruji departed for Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Dr. Prabhu called Guruji at about 8:00 that evening with the information that the heart rate recorded went from 10 per minute to 2 and stopped completely twice. He was even more excited and amazed that the machine kept recording a heartbeat for nearly 10 hours after being disconnected from Guruji. He asked, "What happened? What happened?" His joy knew no limits. Never before in his career had he seen anything like this. He said he would frame the read-out.</p>
<p>Guruji arrived in Los Angeles for the long-awaited Summer Celebration. Sixty people were on seva teams with Ann McFadden at the helm. Nine swamis who were our guests began an intensive sightseeing campaign, dragging Wally and John through Disneyland, Universal Studios, and Sea World starting at 8:00 in the morning. Often you could hear the swamis saying, "Where is Honey?" (Wally's motor home.)</p>
<p>There was a grand Satsang in San Diego with the Swamis. Then as Guruji arrived in L.A. there was a memorable Prayer Conference evening at the famous Agape Center. Everyone spoke about unity. Then Guruji stood up and shocked the audience by saying, "Unity is impossible." He continued by explaining that in order for there to be unity, there has to be two. Yet there is only One in the whole universe.</p>
<p>Next day Guruji gave a beautiful talk at the Unity Church in Tustin. "All of your life becomes a meditation," he said. "Whether you look at the trees or the flowers or talk with people, you are in meditation." He encouraged people to stay with their daily meditation practice. After the talk we all looked up and saw a big puffy heart in the clear blue sky. That evening there was an electrifying Satsang with many birthdays at the Doubletree Hotel with 350 course participants.</p>

  	    <b><p align="CENTER">INFINITE PATIENCE AND SMART SHOPPING</p>
</b><p>Suppose you go to God, get a boon, and walk away. When your intention is to get a boon, then you are in a hurry. Another person who knows he owns God is not in a hurry for anything. Infinite patience comes up in him.</p>
<p>When you know you own God, you are not in a hurry to get something out of God. Your hurry to get something throws you off balance and makes you small. Have "eternal wait," infinite patience. When you have infinite patience, you will realize God belongs to you. Either through awareness or through practice you reach the same spot.</p>
<p>Question: What do you mean by "owning God?"</p>
<p>Answer: The Divinity belongs to you. It's not like shopping at the supermarket in a hurry and rushing back home. When you see the whole store is at home, you are not in a hurry to shop. You are at ease.</p>
<p>Question: To develop patience do we just observe the impatience?</p>
<p>Answer: Just observe the thoughts and feelings and don't regret about it.</p>
<p>When you know you are part of the divine plan, you stop demanding. Then you know everything is being done for you. You are taken care of. Usually we do it the other way: we hurry the mind and are slow in our action. Impatience means hurry in the mind; lethargy means slowness in action.

All the talks listed below are available to you by calling (800) 574-3001 in the U.S. and (503) 227-6411 from outside the U.S.</p>
<p>The Ancient New Age 	Jesus -- Embodiment of Love</p>
<p>The Cosmic Connection -- Planet, Stars, and Life 	Buddha -- Manifestation of Silence</p>
<p>The Ultimate Relationship	Krishna -- Absolute Joy</p>
<p>Death and Beyond</p>
<p>It was a big week. Newspapers published articles, television ran interviews, and hundreds came to attend intro and advanced courses. Teachers from all over North America are being revised and revived. </p>
<p>No one was concerned about the Blackout of( ѹ6XXXXX), which affected six states between Canada and Mexico, because Guruji promised the lights would come on before the talk. And they did! </p>
<p>For people who do not have a teacher in their area and/or have not taken the Intro Course, Guruji is structuring an evening of chanting and knowledge. More on this soon.</p>

<p>As people would crowd into Verna's home and the slamming of car doors after midnight was awakening the entire Bayliss neighborhood, so Guruji played a trick and took everyone to the beach! A big group gathered in the airport, there was a change in flight, and the airport authorities requested our people not to crowd! Rajshree's family hosted a nice Satsang in Yonkers. A public Satsang was given for the first time in Princeton, New Jersey and the talk in New York was greatly admired by everyone. Guruji gave four television programs in this tour, including The Discovery Channel and Korean TV. Before boarding the plane to the UK, Guruji took a private visit to the amusement park (with only 40 people) and the water rides and the roller coaster were great fun. </p>

<p><b>NEWS FLASH</b></p>
<p>After a busy course schedule in the Ashram, Bangalore, Guruji addressed a large group of professionals and industrialists in Rajkot followed by an enthusiastic Satsang of more than 3000 devotees. Decorations and the organization and spirit of the enthusiastic crowd set an example. Guruji left for an advanced course of nearly 700 participants in Koijavaran, Baroda. </p>
<p>P.S. Although the Knowledge Sheet was prepared on time last week there was a delay in sending it and this brought up an interesting fax from Ottawa, Canada which is enclosed here as a supplement:</p>
<p>Thank you for this week's very eloquent Knowledge Fax. We continue to ponder its meaning. In deciphering its meaning we rely on clues that you have given previously. You have said, "I am always talking to you. You only have to look for a sign."</p>
<p>We recognize that many people will say, "There was no Knowledge Fax this week." Of course, they are mistaken. Some people will say, "The Guru finally missed a deadline. Of course, He is just human, like everyone else. He probably ran out of things to say, got tired. Maybe there was no computer nearby. Maybe he called in sick." Some people, asleep, may not have noticed.</p>
<p>However, knowing that the Guru is communicating even when He says nothing at all, we seek the deeper meaning of the week's Knowledge Sheet or Nonsheet. Let us simply say, We seek the deeper meaning of this week's Sandesh. </p>
<p>Option 1: It is all changing</p>
<p>Everything is changing. Nothing stays for all time. "Life is teaching us, at every moment, the art of letting go." Even Knowledge Faxes will not be there for ever. Letting Go. Ultimately we must let go of even the Knowledge as object, as something "out there."</p>
<p>Option 2. I am the Knowledge </p>
<p>Living the knowledge, becoming the knowledge. That is what we must aspire to. The Knowledge Fax is not just a piece of paper, a bit of amusement each week, which titillates the intellect and which we promptly forget, and go about our meaningless and mundane lives. </p>
<p>Sub-Option 2.1. "Enough Knowledge has been given. Digest that." </p>
<p>We must assimilate the Knowledge that has already been given, make it a part of us. There is a rhythm in all things. The cycle of the year goes around again. The cycle of the Knowledge as well. Let us remember and re-learn the knowledge given in the previous cycle. </p>
<p>Option 3. Grace and Gratitude </p>
<p>"To those who have, more will be given. To those who have not, even what little they have will be taken away from them. " </p>
<p>How much gratitude have we had for the Knowledge that has been given each week? How much have we valued the Knowledge Faxes? How much awareness, how much attention have we put on them? Have they become just another routine, something else to take for granted? Wherever we put our attention, that will increase. Have we not put enough attention on the Knowledge Sheets each week?</p>
<p>Option 4. Silence </p>
<p>Truth is beyond words. Therefore whatever we speak is false. Only in silence can we know the Truth. Only in silence can we be the Truth. </p>
<p>Meditate. Be silent. Know thy Self. </p>
<p>Option 5. The Unbaked Pot </p>
<p>When you pour water into an unbaked pot, the water is wasted, and so is the pot. Before you put water into a pot, you should bake the pot. The Guru is now baking all the pots. When they are baked, then he will be able to fill them with the water of Knowledge. But for now, why waste all that good water? </p>
<p>Objection: But how can the pots be baked without the Fire of Knowledge? </p>
<p>This is a very good point. I suppose there are other fires. The fire of criticism and humiliation; the fire of hunger; the fire of lust; the fire of longing; the physical fire of heat. You should ask the Guru to speak on the five fires. </p>
<p>Option 6. The Answer to Last Week's Non-riddle </p>
<p>Look for the meaning hidden in all the events. And a non-event is also an event. There was a "sandesh" contained within the box of Sandesh sweets given to the Guru last week. Similarly, what is the meaning hidden in this week's non-fax?</p>
<p>"Let those who have ears hear." Hearing the silence. This is what we must do. </p>
<p>Option 7. Just Testing </p>
<p>The Guru is testing our level of dismay at not receiving a fax this week. It seems that the level of dismay was appropriately high, as it now appears a fax has indeed been sent, albeit belatedly. (I just called Bill Hayden. Poor Bill. Apparently a good proportion of the people on the continent also called him.) </p>
<p>So what to read into this? Possibility: The Guru is soft-hearted, he cannot bear our disappointment. Or: The Guru is disappointed. We did not receive the silent fax he sent; so he was obliged to send a fax containing words. Or: The Guru is pleased. Our collective dismay at not receiving a fax this week proved to him that we do deeply value the Knowledge given each week and we are extremely grateful or ? ? ?</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> Jai Guru Dev </b> </font></p>
<p>P.P.S. The above Knowledge Fax Supplement was sent by Susannah and the Ottawa Satsang group on 21st September regarding Knowledge Fax #67. </p>

<p>This is the dilemma of life: Everyone is looking for perfect balance. Perfect balance is like a razor's edge. It can only be found in the self.</p>

  		<p><b>NEWS FLASH</b></p>
<p>The big advanced course at the ashram of Kripalu Maharaj (the founder of Kripalu Yoga) at Kayavaran in India brought celebration to the ashram. It was all so well organized that there were no complaints and no one felt lost in the big group. There was one teacher taking care of every 25 people. People were sharing so many miraculous stories.</p>
<p>The outdoor Satsangs in the moon light and Christmas lights simply transformed the place into Brindavan. On the last evening, Guruji appeared in pink silks and was adorned with a crown of beautiful flowers and a peacock feather. Guruji received 400 garlands from devotees. Each garland that hung around Guruji's neck, when being removed took a few hairs with it.</p>
<p>This was a course that started in bliss and ended in chaos. Even though people thought there was no chaos, an impatient aeroplane left Guruji behind after the course, whereas the next plane in the next city and after a three-hour drive, graciously took Him and His group as the last passengers. The race did not end until He boarded His international connecting flight -- again as the last passenger . . . </p>

<p>Navratri means the nine nights and the new night. Creation happens in the darkness. In the womb of the mother and underneath the soil. Nine months in the womb are like nine long nights where the spirit takes human form.</p>
<p>Night provides rest and rejuvenation. At night the entire creation goes to sleep including the ashram night watchman. (Laughter) People working come home at night and they really celebrate, rejoice and pray. Nine nights are precious as they have subtle energy. The subtle is enriched.</p>
<p>There are 64 divine mother impulses which govern the subtle creation. These are responsible for restoring all earthly and spiritual benefits. They are simply part of one's awakened consciousness. These nine nights are celebrated to rekindle those divine impulses and celebrate the innermost depth of our lives.</p>

<p>German Ashram had an intense Teachers Training Course. Guruji went up to Minsk and Belarus, where people had come from as far as Siberia. As many people met Guruji for the first time, it was like a dream come true for them. Virtually everybody had a miraculous experience to tell. One family had spent 7 months salary to come to meet Guruji. Another family sold their house to meet Gurudev. Over 1000 people filled the stadium and the auditorium looked splendid and all the teachers had worked hard to make the stadium look splendid and magnificent. People from Lithuania, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Minsk, and many other towns had gathered in a very festive mood. Russian television covered Guruji's arrival in Mumbai. There was a grand reception for Guruji. When he sat on his seat, all the flowers over him seemed to reach out for his Darshan. It seemed as if there was a waterfall of flowers and Guruji was smiling in the center. In the evening, Guruji was presented with two flowers, with which he played around for hours and kept posing for photographs. The conversation was diverted to the lotus flowers.</p>

</b>
<p>Q: Many ask for blessings but only a few will receive it.  Why?</p>

<p>A: The giver is anyway giving but the taker is not there - the sincerity is missing.  One who gives blessings gives it freely but the one who receives it has to be sincere.  Sincerity is the qualification to receive blessings.  And everyone is free to be sincere at any point of time or space.</p>

<p>Q: Why do people choose to be sincere only sometimes?</p>

<p>A: Because of the illusion that they are going to miss some mundane pleasure.  Hankering after pleasure makes them insincere.  When you are sincere you simply enjoy pleasure.</p>

<p>Poor people fight for food.  Rich people share their food.  Richer are those people who share power.  Richer still are those who share fame.  Richest are those who share themselves.  Richness of a person is indicated by his ability to share and not by what he hoards.  Godliness is enjoying sharing fame.</p>

<p>The silence became alive with Vedic chantings.  The saffron clad Swamis on either side of Guru Dev added luster to the gathering.  The whole Ashram was so vibrant with Divine energy that the renowned pundits who had performed so many Yagyas felt the difference.  As the Pundits became busier, the devotees became serene and still.  The silence was thick and profound and the celebration was loud and colorful.  And with each passing day Guru Dev grew younger and more radiant.  Those who walked near Guru Dev's Kutir would experience different fragrances which kept changing every few minutes!</p>

<p>In the Ashram some people wanted white bread to be served at breakfast.  Some were opposed to this and it caused a big conflict (laughter) because they couldn't find any other reason to be in conflict.  Just one phone call from Guruji set everyone in astonishment.</p>

Guruji addressed a group of medical professionals in the afternoon and an interfaith conference attended by many religious leaders in the evening.  An advanced course followed on the hilltop retreat center.  The experiences of the people were great.  One lady in her mid-thirties had been in a wheelchair and could not walk for several years.  She started walking after she met Guruji on the previous advanced course.  On the last day of the course, Sharmila and Guruji cooked for 20 volunteers who stayed back to clean up, and you know what?  When dinner was served, 60 people showed up!  All were fed with the food left over.</p>

<p>Amid tears and laughter the party moved</p>
<p> on to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  The honorable Minister for Works was present at the official launching of the Malaysian Art of Living Society.  Several prominent leaders came to take blessings from Guruji.  One of them asked, "What is the limit of want?"  Guruji said, "Unhappiness."  It was a colorful evening with Satsang and dinner.  The lights of the local TV stations were so powerful that the circuit breakers switched off twice!</p>

</b>
<p>It is only through merit that you can have faith.  When you lack faith, happiness is neither in the inner nor the outer world.  Happiness springs forth from faith.  Happiness is forgetting the body consciousness.  Pain or sorrow is holding on to the body consciousness.  Whenever you are happy you don't feel the body and when you are miserable, you have aches and pains.</p>

<p>Question: Then why in meditation is the attention taken to various parts of the body?</p>

<p>Guruji: For an arrow to go forward, you have to pull it back.  In the same way when you take the attention to the various parts of the body, it frees you from body consciousness.</p>

<p>Guruji's first whirlwind tour in the Punjab was exhilarating.</p>

<p>Joginder Sing, an 86 year old man, was color blind for the last 10 years and he regained his sense of colors.  The world which was black and white once again became a color movie.</p>

<p>Mr. Sunif Gulati, the Director of the Government Dept of Health, had lost mobility of his neck due to an accident in 1984.  Guruji casually put his hand on his neck and the next day, to his surprise, he gained back total mobility!</p>

<p>Another man, who had varicose veins and had an appointment for surgery, disappointed the surgeon because it was healed on the fourth day of the course.</p>

<p>During the Whole Life fair, Nityanand found a new style of introducing people to the course.  Two gentlemen who came to our stall in the Whole Life fair asked of Nityanand, "What is this?"</p>

<p>Nityanand replied in rhythm, "Neither I know nor you, just sign up!"</p>

<p>The gentlemen, who were tired of listening to the lengthy explanations from all the other stalls, jumped up and said, "Wow! This is the real thing!".  They signed up for the course!</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">HOW TO DEAL WITH RUDE BEHAVIOR</p>
</b>
<b><p>What do you do when someone behaves very rudely to you?</p>
</b><p>1. Get upset</p>
<p>2. React rudely back</p>
<p>3. Get frustrated</p>
<p>4. Run-away  from and avoid the person or the situation</p>
<p>5. Blame the person</p>
<p>6. Preach to the person</p>

<p>None of these will in any way strengthen you.</p>

<b></b><p><b>Then what are the options?</b>  See rude behavior in this light:</p>
<p>1. It indicates the intensity of their commitment</p>
<p>2. It indicates the amount of stress and insensitivity</p>
<p>3. It projects the up-bringing of the person</p>
<p>4. It indicates a behavioral pattern</p>
<p>5. It shows lack of knowledge</p>
<p>6. It shows lack of observation of one's own mind and its sensations</p>
<p>7. It shows you behavior to avoid</p>
<p>8. It is an opportunity for you to welcome and absorb the rudeness</p>
<p>9. It strengthens your mind</p>
<p>10. It unconditions the love that you are</p>

<p>The next time when someone is rude to you, make sure you don't get upset.  Just give back a broad smile.</p>

<p>If you can digest the rudeness, nothing whatsoever can shake you.</p> 		</font>

<p>Guruji came from Delhi for an overnight stay at the Ashram and left the next morning to Kerala.  Organizers in Delhi as well as in Cochin (Trivandrum and Trichur) had experienced very clearly the non-doership of the big event.  Everything fell in its space at the right moment as always.  Enthusiastic devotees in Cochin renovated their homes.  After Cochin, Guruji rushed to the colorful Trichur (In Trichur as usual there was chaos and asana-snatch).  Excellent team work and elaborate arrangements were appreciated by thousands who came to the Satsang.  The Kerala-style decorated elephants with umbrellas and the ballkas dressed in traditional attire carrying lights and flowers were a spectacular welcome.  Many people shared their amazing healing experiences.  Then the whole troop moved to Trivandrum, the town of infinity.  The king of Kerala received Guruji at the Senate Hall with a packed audience of 4000 people.  Colorful umbrellas, elephants, the traditional horns and drums and the Vedic chanting filled the air.  People were enraptured for a three and a half hour program.  The next morning newspapers were filled with the news of the Art of Living Satsang.</p>

</b>
<p>You have five aspects to yourself:  Asti (is-ness); Bhaati (Knowledge, expression); Preeti (love); Nama (name); and Rupa (form).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Matter has two aspects: name and form.  </p>

<p>Consciousness has three aspects: "is-ness" - that it is; knowingness/expression - it knows and expresses; and love - it is loving.</p>

<p>This is the secret of the whole universe.</p>

<p>Maya is not being aware of the three aspects of consciousness.  Ignorance is when one is caught up in the name and form.</p>

<p>Question: Why are we imperfect?</p>

<p>Answer: So that we can grow to perfection.  Life is a movement from imperfection to perfection.  A seed contains the tree but the seed has to cease to be a seed to become a tree.  The seed is not perfect.  The sapling is not perfect.  It has to cease to be a sapling to become a tree.  So in life you can either see imperfection at every step, or you can see a movement from one perfection to another perfection.</p>

<p>Wherever you put your attention then that will grow.  If you put your attention on the lack of something, the lack will increase.</p> 		</font>

<p>Self-reliance needs enormous courage.</p>

<p>Surrender needs less courage.</p>

<p>A person who cannot surrender cannot be self-reliant either.</p>

<p>If you don't have enough courage to surrender, then it is impossible  for you to be self-reliant.  You simply fool yourself.   People who are afraid to surrender fool themselves.   Because even a little fear is detrimental to self-reliance.</p>

<p>If you don't have a hundred dollars, you cannot have a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Self-reliance contains surrender.   Fifty dollars contains ten dollars.</p>

<p>Question:    Why does self-reliance need so much courage?</p>

<p>When you want to depend on yourself for everything, there is nobody else, then it needs a lot of courage.</p>

<p>Often people think that surrender is a way to escape from  responsibility and they end up blaming the Divine for all their problems.   In fact, the  true surrender is taking total responsibility for everything.</p>

<p>Susannah:    How can we do that?</p>

<p>You take responsibility and you pray for help.</p>

</b><p>Different organs of our body are governed by different devas. The solar plexus is connected with the sun, that's why it is called "solar" plexus. When the first rays of the sun fall on the solar plexus, it is very good for your body. Doing <i>Surya Namaskar</i> ("sun salutation") yoga asana in the early morning is very good. The solar plexus has a profound impact on the central nervous system, optic nerves, stomach, and what we usually call "gut feeling." It is the second brain in your body. Usually the solar plexus is slightly bigger than an almond. Studies have shown that with the practice of yoga, meditation, and Sudarshan Kriya, the solar plexus can become as a large as the size of the palm. Then it performs better. It balances the body functions. When the solar plexus expands, the intuitive mind works better. The mind becomes clear and focussed. When the solar plexus contracts, one feels horrible, sad, depressed, and all the negative feelings come.</p>
<p>Krishna was called Padmanabha, meaning "whose navel is the size of a lotus flower." If you become Padmanabha, you become absolutely creative. Brahma, the Creator, is born out of a blossomed solar plexus.</p>
<p>These days, the solar plexus remains small, but the tummy keeps getting bigger.</p>

<p>In <i>Bhakti</i> there are four letters.  It's made up of "bha", "ka", "ta", and "i" (ee).  "Bha" stands for fulfillment and nourishment.  "Ka" stands for knowing - a means of knowing.  "Ta" stands for redeeming, for saving, for salvation.  "I" (ee) stands for <i>shakti</i>.</p>

<p>So in <i>Bhakti</i> four things are there: fulfillment and nourishment; means of knowing; "<i>tarana</i>" or salvation; and energy.  <i>Bhakti</i> saves you.  <i>Bhakti</i> nourishes you.  <i>Bhakti</i> is the means of knowing, the right knowledge.  When <i>Bhakti</i> is there the doubts don't come.  It gives the most energy.  So <i>Bhakti</i> contains as the seed all the four qualities.</p>

<p>All the emotional upheavals one undergoes is because one doesn't know <i>Bhakti</i>.  When all intense feelings flow in one direction that is <i>Bhakti</i>, it becomes <i>Bhakti</i>.  What is the difference between a canal and a flooded field?  In a flood what happens is the water does not have a bank to flow in.  When the water flows within banks you call it "river".  When water is scattered all over, it's all flooded.  So when the emotions get flooded everywhere, mind is in a mess.  If it is intensely flowing in a direction, then that is <i>Bhakti</i>.  And that is most powerful.</p>

The Satsang group met in the airport VIP lounge on the way back during a stop over in St. Lucia (a Caribbean island). There was a diplomatic reception in Curacao (another island near Venezuela) and a big Satsang. For the first public talk there was a full house. On to Panama, where Martine and Dr. Chu hosted a large Satsang and then Shirley was the copilot of the small plane that took the group to the Panama Canal. Manu, from Hong Kong, is organizing courses all over Central and South America. Marjorie and her team organized a packed house for a great talk in Costa Rica. This trip gave a huge boost to the spreading of the knowledge throughout the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<b></b><p><b>Short story</b>: Guruji was walking along the beach with some devotees and there was a huge desalination plant (changes salt water to fresh water) costing millions of dollars. Nearby was a coconut tree. Guruji looked and pointed out that the tree is a natural desalination plant. It takes the salt water from the earth and makes the fresh water inside the coconut. The knowledge is like the tree -- it takes us from salty mud to the pure bliss.</p>

<p>Indigestion of knowledge leads to development of a false ego which has no cure.  Knowledge must be digested properly.</p>

<p>Indigestion of knowledge leads to:</p>

</font><ol><font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">

</font><li>False ego</li>
<li>Disinterestedness; taking for granted; lack of awareness</li>
<li>Familiarity without understanding, without depth -- flakiness</li>

<li>Using knowledge for their own small ends</li>
<li>Adamancy</li></ol>


<p>Your inability to do something (break a habit) can cause a pinch; when you are deeply pained by something, then that will rid you of that habit.  If you are pained by your shortcomings, then you are sadhak.  Pain takes you out of addiction.</p>

<p>If you are in love with the divine, then you can digest the knowledge.  Love is the appetizer -- seva is the exercise -- without love and seva, knowledge becomes indigestible.  So everyone list the loving seva you have done for the world.</p>

<p>Marielle:	If love is the appetizer, what is the main course?</p>
<p>Guruji:	Knowledge</p>
<p>Daniel:	What is dessert?</p>

Everyone felt the unity inspired by the songs from the church choir and Bhajans by Divya followed by electrifying talks.  Monday Guruji started a series of talks to an overflowing crowd at the Miramar Sheraton Hotel.  A lady in her 50s who had an accident and lost mobility in her arm, came the next day and was amazed that she could now easily lift her arm all the way over her head.

</b><p>You don't need to worry to maintain knowledge. When knowledge is lodged in you as wisdom, it will never leave you. Wisdom lodges itself in your heart. Make the Divine your Valentine (your sweet Beloved). This is the last thing to do and the first thing to do. Keep your heart in a safe place; it is too delicate. Events, small things make strong impressions on it. And you cannot find a better place than the Divine to keep your heart safe and your mind sane. When you keep your heart in the Divine, the moving time, the passing events, will not be able to touch it, will not create a scar. A precious stone needs a setting around it, gold or silver, to hold it and to wear it; so wisdom and knowledge are that setting around the heart which will hold it in the Divine.</p>
<p>See the Divine in your Valentine and make the Divinity your Valentine (your sweet beloved). Just BE. . .and know that you are LOVED... That is BELOVED.</p>

<p>The residents of Rishikesh experienced the first rain in several months on the day Guruji arrived!  Teachers from all over India have arrived for their annual meeting and refresher.  Guruji is using this temporary respite to go through mountains of mail!</p>

<p>A team of doctors conducted a free medical camp in Urugalli, Karnataka, where over 2500 villagers were given diagnoses and medicines.</p>

<p>From four die-hard devotees rapidly recovering from a traffic accident from buoyant BARODA : </p>
<p>Thanks to Guruji's incredible grace and the loving seva of Baroda Satsangees, we are all strong and rejoicing.  There is life on earth and life after death.  For one brief moment, we were blessed with the vision of both.  Now we are truly celebrating this life - its pain, humor, chaos and joy in total gratitude and surrender to the Divine.</p>

<p>Life is utterly simple and yet most complex.  You have to simultaneously attend to both facets of  life.  When life appears most complex, turn to the simplicity.  Simplicity brings peace.  When you are peaceful attend to the complexity within you.  That will make you more skillful.</p>

<p>If you are only with simplicity, it makes you lazy and dull.  Being only with complexity makes you angry and frustrated.  The intelligent ones balance them and rejoice in both.  If you look only to simplicity, growth is not there.  Looking only at the complexity, there is no life at all.  All that you need is a skillful balance.  If you recognize both simplicity and complexity of life, you will be skillfully peaceful!</p>

<p>Colors are the complexity of life.  White is the simplicity.  When your heart is pure, your life becomes so colorful. </p>

<p>Vikram: Guruji, you are all white and yet so colorful.</p>

</b>
<p>Fear is an impression of the past reflecting about the future of the present.  When people deny fear, they become egocentric, when they recognize and accept fear, they go beyond...get free from it.</p>

<p>Total lack of fear is possible only in utter chaos or utmost orderliness.  A saint or a fool have no fear.  But everywhere in between there is fear.  Fear is essential to preserve orderliness in the world.  It is a primal instinct.</p>

<p align="CENTER">FEAR OF DEATH PRESERVES LIFE.</p>
<p align="CENTER">FEAR OF  WRONG KEEPS THE RIGHT.</p>
<p align="CENTER">FEAR OF SICKNESS BRINGS HYGIENE.</p>
<p align="CENTER">FEAR OF MISERY KEEPS YOU RIGHTEOUS.</p>

<p>A CHILD HAS A PINCH OF FEAR SO IT IS CAREFUL AND ALERT WHILE WALKING.  A PINCH OF FEAR IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THINGS MOVING SMOOTHLY.</p>

<p>Because fear is love standing upside down, everything that can be interpreted with Love can also be interpreted with fear.  For example, a child clinging onto its mother.  This can be interpreted in both ways - out of Love or out of Fear.</p>

<p>This primal instinct can be totally transformed through Awareness of Divine Love.</p>

<p>Do not try to eliminate fear.  Just meditate and know that you are nobody or that you belong to someone special...</p> 		</font>

  	    <p align=" CENTER"><b>THREE KINDS OF LOVE</b></p>
<p>There are three kinds of Love.  The Love that comes out of Charm, that which comes out of comfort, and the <b>Divine Love</b>.  Do you see what I am saying?</p>

<p>The love that comes out of charm does not last long.  It comes out of unfamiliarity or out</p>
<p> of attraction.  In this you lose the attraction fast, and boredom sets in, like most love marriages.  This love may diminish and bring along with it fear, uncertainty, insecurity, and sadness.</p>

<p>The Love that comes out of comfort and familiarity grows.  But this Love has no thrill, no enthusiasm, joy, or fire to it.  For example, you are more comfortable with an old friend who is a familiar person, rather than with a new person.</p>

<p>The <b>Divine Love</b> supersedes both the above.  The Divine Love has ever newness.  The closer you go, there is more charm and depth.  The Divine Love has comfort, enthusiasm, and familiarity.  There is never boredom and it keeps everyone on their toes.</p>

<b><p>Worldly love can be like an ocean, yet an ocean has a bottom.  The Divine Love is like the sky which is limitless, infinite.  From the bottom of the Ocean, soar into the vast sky.</p>

<p>During a visit to Adichunchunagiri Ashram, Guruji said that this devotees are waiting for him and he must return soon.  "No, let them wait.  Waiting for the Guru is <i>tapas</i> (penance).  Waiting for the world is <i>tapa</i> (torture)," replied the Swamiji of that ashram.  </p>

<p>In the northeastern region at Guwahati, the jubilant crowd of the generally conservative and closed society turned limitlessly wild.  An elaborate banquet for 1500 devotees followed the Satsang.  Four buses and twelve cars with 180 devotees, left for Shillong, the Meghalayan Capital also called "The Scotland of the East."  En route, the devotees stopped for a picnic on the banks of a large lake and for rides on a speed boat.  All the satsangees of Shillong behaved like an old bunch, though they were meeting Guruji for the first time.  On his return, Calcutta had a Mega Satsang in the Science city auditorium.</p>

<p>P.S.  Guruji has now arrived in Bangalore.  Sukha Nadi (5,000 year old palm leaf scripture) mentioned Guruji's name and that he is the incarnation of Lord Krishna.  There is a temple of Mother Divine 300 km from the Ashram.  The idol of this deity writes and answers questions of devotees.  This deity visited our Ashram and She "wrote" that she was extremely happy about the work of our Ashram.  She also "wrote" that the spirits of both Lord Krishna and the Mother Divine reside in Guruji.  She also "wrote" that all Guruji's devotees are in the most right path and are peaceful, calm, and settled.</p>

<p>When your mind is not complaining, responsible, courageous, confident and hollow and empty you are inexplicably beautiful.  A person who cannot correct or act has no right to complain.  And when a person can correct or act, he will never complain. Complaining is a sign of weakness.  Complaining is the nature of utter ignorance where one does not know the Self.  Complaint takes away the Beauty that is inborn in you. And it shows up more on the one who is on this path.</p>

<p>Worldly mind is a complaining mind; Divine mind is a dancing mind.  Just complaining without indicating the solution is irresponsibility. When the solutions are not workable, finding alternative solutions is Courage.</p>

<p>Pleasure or pain is an intense sensation in the 4 to 6 &nbsp;foot body.  When we are not caught up in this then we are truly and sincerely able to say, "I belong to you."  That is when all the cravings and aversions, desires and doubts fall off -- and in a moment the world belongs to you.  All your miseries surround the "I, I, I, . . . ", "I want this, I like that, I don't  like this . . ."  Just let go.  The sun rises and sets, the grass grows, the river flows,  the moon shines and I am here forever!</p>

<p>How do you feel if someone praises you?</p>
<p>Answer: "Shy, happy, great, embarrassed . . . "</p>

<p>It does something to you, doesn't it?  It doesn't do anything to me!  When you praise the moon, the mountains, Lake Lucerne, the Black Forest . . .it doesn't do anything to them.  They remain the same.</p>
<p>Just like that I am part of nature.  If you enjoy praising me, you may do so.  In fact, you have no choice!  (Laughter)</p>
<p>You can do with me whatever you like.  I am there for you.  I am your toy!  (Laughter)</p> 		</font>

<p>Time literally stood still in Mauritius.  In Satish's house where Guruji stayed, all six clocks and everybody's watches mysteriously stopped!  But anyway, Guruji moved on to South Africa where he addressed enthusiastic crowds in Pretoria and Johannesburg.  Then on to Botswana where Guruji was received by the President at the State House.  Later, Guruji visited a Government Hospital and distributed toys and gifts of clothes and food to the ailing children in the pediatric ward.  The children loved it!  It was Santa Claus but with a black beard and trim tummy!  Guruji distributed blankets and food to the aged and disabled of the entire village of Modipane.  The people were overwhelmed and greeted Guruji with joy and cheer.  Enthusiastic devotees of Botswana's Art of Living are organizing big basic courses and great satsangs.  The tired group went on an African Safari and found two leopards, five  elephants, a vulture with a broken wing, and two monkeys!  The only enthusiastic person was the guide.  The giggling gang went on and on.  Joy knew no bounds and people were forgetting traffic rules as usual.  Hema spooned hot pickle into her tea instead of sugar!</p>

<p>The Ahmedabad chapter organized a blood donation camp and Bangalore organized a mass feeding of the poor.  And in Bad Antogast there was a five story birthday cake with marzipan swans.</p>

<p>Instead of "How are you?" Guruji greeted everyone with "How am I?"</p>

<p>If your are unhappy you better check if one or all of these are lacking: <i>Tapa</i> (penance), <i>Vairagya </i>(dispassion), <i>Sharanagati</i> (surrender).</p>
<p>- <i>Tapas</i> is agreeing with the moment, total acceptance of pleasant or unpleasant situations.</p>
<p>- <i>Vairagya</i> means I want nothing and I am nothing.</p>
<p>- <i>Sharanagati</i> is "I am here for You, for Your joy."</p>

<p>If you are grumbling then these are lacking, because when you accept the situation you cannot grumble; when you take it as <i>Tapa</i> you will not grumble; when you come from a state dispassion ("I don't want anything") you don't grumble; and if you are surrendered you will have no complaints.</p>

<p>All these three (<i>Tapas, Vairagya</i> and surrender) purify your mind and uplift you in joy.</p>

<p>If you donҴ do it willingly you will do it in desperation. First you say, "Nothing can be done."  Then in anger and desperation you say, "I give up, I want nothing, I have no choice, to hell with it!"</p> 		</font>

  	    <b></b><p align="CENTER"><b>THE PERSONAL AND IMPERSONAL</b> </p>

<p>How can we reconcile the impersonal with the personal? </p>

<p>In love you raise the object to life. When you love an object it becomes life. For children everything is personal. Children take each object they play with and make it totally personal. Even a stone has a face; even the sun laughs. When you attach emotion, the whole creation becomes personal.  When you remove the emotion, even people become objects. Violence is removing the emotion.  How a person can kill another person: it is when they do not see them as a person, they see them as an object. But even a stone attracts reverence when it becomes personal. </p>

<p>Dean says: In military training they teach soldiers to see people as killing objects coming toward you that need to be killed first. </p>

<p>Susannah says: In the temple even a stone is elevated to the level of spirit. </p>

<p>The impersonal cannot attract reverence. Most people see God as impersonal and therefore they do not progress. </p>

<p>Dean and Susannah say: "That's why we need a Guru!" </p>

<p>Chan says: When we say something isn't real, then it's impersonal. When we personalize</p>
<p>something, we make it real. So then, what is reality? </p>

<p>You are the Reality. You are not the thoughts, you are not the emotions nor actions. You are not even a person...! </p>

<p>Exercise: What you now see as impersonal, see it as personal. And when you feel any negative emotion towards anybody, see them as impersonal. And pretend that you yourself are a robot. </p>

<p>If someone doubts your love and you constantly have to prove it, this becomes a heavy load on your head.</p>
<p>When someone doubts your love, they start questioning you and demanding explanations for all your actions.</p>
<p>To explain everything you do is a burden. Your nature is to shed the burden, and so you don't feel comfortable.</p>
<p>When you question the reason behind an action, you are asking for justice for yourself. You are creating a distance when you ask for justice. Your whole intention is to come close, but you are creating a distance.</p>
<p>You are a witness to all your actions. You are as much a stranger to your own actions as you are to someone else's. You are the Eternal Witness.</p>
<p>When someone asks for an explanation, they are speaking from doership and imposing that doership on you. This brings discomfort. </p>
<p>If somebody is just there with you, like a part of you, they don't question you. They are like your arm. There is thorough understanding and questions don't arise. </p>

<p>Often what is universal is not personal and what is personal does not belong to everyone. What is "mine" and what is "universal" are completely opposite. This is the cause of greed, fear, jealousy, and lack of contentment. On this Guru Purnima wake up and realize that the Lord of the Universe is very personal to you. Your personal Guru is the Guru of the whole world. The Guru is your very SELF and your SELF is the very life in every being. Make the universal personal; it makes you richer, wiser, stronger.

<p>Sri Sri Ravi Shankar: Thank them. They have given you freedom. (Laughter and amazement) When people respect you, they often take away your freedom. They expect you to smile at them, recognize them, behave in a certain way with them.</p>
<p>If they don't respect you, you are not obliged to answer their questions and you can drop all the formalities. Either you will be naturally smiling or frowning. So you will be complete.</p>
<p>When people love and respect you, you are obliged to return their courtesies because you don't want to hurt them. When they don't respect or love you, they will not be hurt by your actions and expressions. So they set you free. </p>
<p>When you gain respect, you often do it at the cost of your freedom. Wisdom is to put the freedom first and not bother about respect. </p>
<p>Q: Will freedom not bring arrogance? </p>
<p>A: True freedom is not an "I don't care" attitude. It is lightness from within, a genuine smile and not stiffness. </p>
<p>When someone is stiff and arrogant, they are not really free. True love blossoms only in such freedom. </p>

<p>Sacrifice brings strength in life. Life without sacrifice is stagnant. Sacrifice gives you the quantum leap. It takes you to a higher pedestal.</p>

<p>A life without sacrifice is worth nothing. Zeal, enthusiasm, strength and joy are all connected to sacrifice.</p>

But the human being has both abilities, he divides and synthesizes. Ants only synthesize, they bring Things Together And Build An Ant Hill. But Monkeys Cannot Synthesize, They Can Only Divide Everything. You Give Them a garland for example, and they tear it to pieces and throw it all over the place. A monkey can only divide, or analyze. But a beaver synthesizes, it brings all the wood together and builds a dam. Birds also synthesize such as the Weaver birds.</font></p><font face="Arial">
<p>A human being both analyzes and synthesizes. So you analyze from the relative world and synthesize to find the one. The intellect divides to find the truth. Truth once found synthesizes everything.</p>
<p>When the intellect becomes quiet, it brings out the intelligence. Often people think that gathering information makes one intelligent. This is not so. It is the "<i>samadhi</i>" which brings out the intelligence.</p>
<p>An unintelligent man, in spite of having all the information, cannot be creative. An intelligent man without much information can be creative.</p>
<p>A sign of intelligence is to see the one in many and find the many in one.</p>
<p>There is an old Sanskrit proverb: The first sign of intelligence is not to start anything. The second sign of intelligence is if you have started something, you have to continue it to the end.</p>

<p>Harish : What About The Questions That We Ask With Complete Faith? </p>
<p>Sri Sri : If you have faith in God or yourself or your family and friends then questions cannot arise. When you know somebody is taking care of you, what is the need to ask any question? For example, if you have taken the Karnataka Express to Bangalore, then there is no need to ask at every station "Where is the train going?". When there is someone to take care of your desire, then why go to an astrologer?</p>
<p>Rajesh : But what about blind faith?</p>
<p>Sri Sri : Faith is faith...it cannot be blind. When you call it blind it is not faith - at least not yours! Blindness and faith cannot meet. It is when you lose faith, you become blind.</p> 		</font>

<p>Love is your nature. </p>
<p>In the process of its expression, you often get caught up in the object. This is when your sight is caught outside. To return back to your nature, you need insight.</p>

<b></b><p><b>	Energy</b> is the second insight.</p>

<b></b><p><b>	Divine Love</b> is the third insight.</p>
<p>A glimpse of Divine love makes you so complete and over rules all the relative pleasures.</p>
<b></b><p><b>	Trance</b> is the fourth insight.</p>
<p>An elevation of consciousness and partial awareness of the physical reality around is Trance.</p>
<b></b><p><b>	Non-dual existence</b>, that all is made up of one and only one, is the fifth insight.</p>

<p>Feeling or experiencing the infinity within this finite body, living the timelessness within the time span of life, uncovering the bliss within the misery. This is what you are here for.</p>

<p>Today is Diwali - the Festival of Lights.  The streets and buildings are lit up with colorful lights.  The four aspects of Diwali:</p>

<p>1.  The lights: Symbolic of spreading the Knowledge.</p>
<p>2.  Fire crackers: When the explosion happens outside, the explosion inside is diffused.</p>
<p>3.  Gift exchange and distribution of sweets:  Sweets dispel the bitterness and renew the friendship.</p>
<p>4.  Feeling abundance: Brings awareness and gratefulness for what one has.</p>

<p>When true wisdom dawns, it gives rise to celebration, and in celebration you may lose focus or awareness.  The ancient rishis knew this so to maintain awareness in the midst of gaiety of celebration, they brought sacredness and puja to every celebration.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">Celebrate the Knowledge and feel the abundance, for "those who have will be given more"!</p>

A Maha Kriya was held for 2,000.  Lunch served to 4,000 without a hitch was a marvel to behold, and volunteers were jumping and dancing by the end of the day.</p>

<p>After Satsang in Pune, crowds crushed onto the stage for Darshan with Guruji, while volunteers were busy controlling the ever-enthusiastic crowd.  The thousands of pairs of neatly packaged and numbered shoes in the entry way got into disarray in the chaos which followed.  Many people lost their shoes but they were too happy to care.</p>

<p>The next morning, in spite of it's being a peak-season Diwali business day, 1,800 course graduates joined Guruji for Satsang.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, on this day of Diwali festival, 60 blind women are beginning a week-long residential course at the Bangalore Ashram.</p>

<p>As Diwali celebrations continue in the valley of the Saints, the candlelight Satsangs were electrifying. Advanced course participants broke all barriers of planning and management as 200 people dropped in without prior intimation. Thanks to the volunteers, smiles prevailed on 500 odd.....!! faces. The Advanced Course participants cleaned up tons of garbage from the banks of the Ganga.</p>
<p>Note : Indian teachers and Organizers have resolved to start the following Sri Sri Seva Projects ( S S S P) and all the Satsang groups are invited to join in.</p>
<p>1. Minimum 2% of individual income should be donated towards rural development and hygiene.</p>
<p>2. Contact your nearest supermarkets / stores and encourage them to use paper or cloth bags instead of plastic bags.</p>
<b><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b> Jai Guru Dev </b> </font></p>
</b><p><b>To the USA Satsang Groups</b>:</p>
<p>As you've recently read in the National Newsletter, Saturday, November 22nd is National Seva Day!!! We encourage all of you to organize and participate in Seva projects in your community as a group. This is a wonderful way to appreciate Guru Dev's message of service, bring the Satsang group closer together, as well as promote the Art of Living as a positive force in the community. </p>
<p>There are many projects which you can organize. For example, you can volunteer at a local food bank, shelter, or meal distribution center; you can contribute to a convalescence home as visitors to the patients; you can participate in literacy programs for Adult Education or volunteer at schools; and you can affiliate your Satsang with any number of national and local volunteer organizations (such as Habitat for Humanity 1-800-HABITAT, City Cares of America 1-212-533-4734, the Red Cross, the Names Project, etc.). You can be creative--there is so much Seva to be done! You can even look under "Volunteer" in the Yellow Pages! </p>
<p>Please contact your local teacher for organizational help, and any of us for aid in coming up with ideas, contact information, or anything else we can assist you with! </p>

<p>1. Get frustrated</p>

<p>...and you have seen that none of these work. They only make the situation worse. What is the way out of this? How do you maintain your lovingness? </p>

<p>1.Have patience and change your expression of love.</p>
<p>2. Be centered and limit your expression of love. Sometimes over-expression of love puts people off.</p>
<p>3. Take it for granted that they love you too and accept their style of expression.  For example, a mother with three kids.  One child talks, one child does not talk, one child throws tantrums.  Mother's love is the same irrespective of their behavior.</p>
<p>4. Genuinely acknowledge their love for you. This will turn your demand into gratefulness and the more you are grateful in life, the more love comes your way.</p>
<p>5. Know that hurt is part of love and take responsibility for it. When you move away from your center, you will definitely get hurt and the nature of worldliness is misery.</p> 		</font>

<p>Ego causes heaviness, discomfort. It doesn't let love flow. Ego can be transcended by knowing the Truth; by enquiring "Who am I?" Often, your attitude towards one who has ego is of contempt or jealousy. But rather you should have compassion, or even pity, isn't it?</p>
<p>There is also a positive aspect of ego. It drives one to do some work. A person will do a job either out of compassion or out of ego. Most of the work in the society is by boosting the ego. But in Satsang, work is done out of love. Ego is separateness; non-belongingness. It is wanting to prove and to possess. </p>
<p>And when you wake up and see, there is nothing to be proved and nothing to possess, ego dissolves.</p>

</b><p>Sri Avtar Hari, a well known Saint from Haridwar, blessed the Ashram and was with Guruji for three days. The Russians, Polish, Chinese and other international groups, left for God's own country - Kerala, with Guruji! The first stop at the state capital Thiruvananthapuram saw a gathering of six thousand people. From there the entourage rode to Cochin. At Cochin, the open ground by the seaside was fabulously decorated. Caparisoned elephants in traditional style and little angels with flowers and lamps accorded a warm welcome. The big ground was packed with around ten thousand people. Imagine how much time it took for the Darshan line! Then on to the cultural capital of Kerala - Thrissur where again over five thousand people gathered for a grand satsang in an indoor stadium. The teamwork at Thrissur was a unique example and this time around, the volunteers felt no pressure; they did very little but a lot happened. The entourage proceeded to Calicut. Not a space even for an ant to crawl at the biggest auditorium in Calicut and many had to be content watching the satsang in the closed circuit television placed outside. </p>
<p>The volunteers did a marvelous job throughout Kerala. Many healing experiences were reported during Satsangs. Guruji is back in the Bangalore Ashram for an other fortnight.</p>

<p align="CENTER">Celebration Is Pure Vibration</p>
</font></b><p><font face="Arial">Human life is a combination of matter, i.e., body and spirit or vibration. Isn't it? Pleasure or joy is becoming intense vibration. Joy is forgetting that you are matter and so you become intense vibration. All the carnal instincts will also make you feel intense vibrations momentarily. And that's how they give a glimpse of joy. But the thing is, it is short lived and it makes you dense later on. Pleasure that comes from Satsang is of a higher nature. Mantra and singing create vibrations in the spirit. That's why when you sing, the ecstasy stays for a long time. Pleasure in the subtle is long lasting, energizing, refreshing and freeing. Pleasure from the gross is short lived, tiring and binding.</font></p><font face="Arial">
<p>When you know you are electricity (vibration/energy), then craving, greed, lust and anger disappear. And you become true celebration.</p>
<b></b><p><b>Message for Christmas:</b> You are the Christmas tree. The Christmas tree is pointing upwards and its branches grow on all sides. It is orderly. At the time of year when no tree bears anything, it has many gifts to offer. And it is green throughout the year. A Christmas tree bears the gifts and the lights not for itself. All the gifts you are carrying in your life are for others. Anyone who comes to you, you offer them your gifts.</p>
<p>There were lots of gifts around Sri Sri's couch. John asked Sri Sri, "Are you going to open the gifts?" Sri Sri winked and pointed at the people and said, "I am always opening the gifts." (Laughter)</p>
<p>Your life is a gift. And you have come to unwrap the gift. In the process of unwrapping, you also save the wrappers. Your whole environment, situations, circumstances and body are the wrapping papers. When we unwrap, we destroy the wrapping paper. We are in such a hurry at times that we even destroy the gifts. With patience and endurance, open your gifts and save the wrapping papers.</p>

<p>Don't let politics sway you away from the path. If you are afraid of politics you cannot be successful in the spiritual realm. You have to cross the barricade of politics. It is the test of your strength, commitment, and your focus. You <u>cannot</u> avoid politics, but to harbor it in your mind or <u>not,</u> is your choice. There were politics among the 12 apostles, and with Buddha. And Krishna was in politics from head to toe. And you say you don't want politics? The more you don't want it, the more you will harbor it in your consciousness. When you recognize politics in any group or Satsang, that is a blessing for you to be centered and go inward. You can do that without blaming the group and running away from people, or chickening out. It can enhance your skill to act and <u>not</u> get attached. </p>
<p>Advantages of politics:</p>
<p>-- Brings up diversity in people.</p>
<p>-- Puts in front of you different viewpoints, ways, and tendencies.</p>
<p>-- Enhances your skill to communicate and act.</p>
<p>-- Brings centeredness and dispassion.</p>
<p>-- Shakes you up and makes you stand up to the knowledge.</p>
<p>-- Enhances your capacity to accept and tolerate.</p>
<p>-- Makes you realize the whole life is a game.</p>
<p>Cross the threshold of politics and come to the Divine.</p>
<p>The strong will smile through the politics and the weak will lament.</p>

<p>Many people think tolerance is a virtue.</p>
<p>Tolerance is a negative term. If you like something you don't have to tolerate. Tolerance indicates a deep sense of dislike, which can at any time turn into hatred. It indicates a sense of separateness . . small mindedness . . limitation of consciousness.</p>
<p>When you are tolerating, it is a temporary state. Tolerance is a potential volcano. If you are tolerating it means you are holding on.</p>
<p>Acceptance is also negative. You accept that which is not lovable.</p>
<p>Question: Don't you need a sense of self-assurance to then go and love people?</p>
<p>This is our company. The Self-Assurance Company. It is only the Self that is always assuring. Nothing else.</p>
<p>Tolerance and acceptance come with judgment and separation. These words which are used,&nbsp;tolerance and acceptance are thought to be positive. I say they are not.</p>
<p>Question: But aren't we supposed to accept people as they are?</p>
<p>If you don't love them, then you have to accept them.</p>
<p>DON'T ACCEPT PEOPLE AS THEY ARE. JUST LOVE THEM AS THEY ARE.</p>

<p>Organization needs attention to details, a material awareness. Organization is being worldly.</p>
<p>Devotion is getting lost, forgetting the world, being in ecstasy.</p>
<p>These are opposite in nature. They don't go together, yet they cannot be apart or exist without each other. No organization can arise without devotion. When there is so much devotion, you simply want to organize. Devotion brings faith, compassion, and responsibility. With responsibility and caring, you want to give knowledge, wisdom, and love. Then organization happens. So organization exists through devotion.</p>
<p>If you are devoted, you won't just sit. The nature of devotion is to give. If you think you are devoted and you are not caring for the world, then you are merely selfish. Real devotion means being one with the Divine, and the Divine cares for the world.</p>
<p>Often you lose devotion in organizing. And often in the name of devotion you create chaos and disregard the organization. You have to be a saint to be both in organization and devotion. If you have both, you are on the mark. So . . .</p>

</font></b><p><font face="Arial">Blessed are those who don't see a mistake as a mistake....!!!</font></p><font face="Arial">
<p>But it is hard not to see your own mistake. Outwardly you may justify yourself or prove your innocence to someone else, but a mistake pricks a conscience. Do not justify yourself. Instead, feel the prick of the mistake. That very pinch will take you out of the mistake. </p>
<p>A mistake means something that brings misery to you in the long run. So why would someone knowingly commit a mistake?</p>
<p>While pointing out a mistake to someone, do you consider him as separate from you and go on pointing out his error or do you make him feel a part of you? When you point out a mistake to someone, does it make him more stressed, or does it create more awareness in that person? Often you do not point out someone's mistake when it is required. Not pointing out a mistake -- with due consideration to time and place -- is also a mistake.</p>
<p>When you make a new mistake, it is not a mistake; you have learned a valuable lesson. But when you keep doing the same mistake over and over, it is a <b>BIG</b> mistake. A mistake simply means you have missed taking a lesson that has come your way.</p>
<p>Do not lament over your mistake. Just take the lesson from it. You will not be judged by your mistakes, but by your virtues. Mistakes are of the earth. Virtues are of the Divine.</p>
<b><p>Wise is the one who learns from other's mistakes.</p>
<p>Less wise is the one who learns from his own mistakes.</p>
<p>The fool keeps making the same mistakes again and again and never learns from them.</p>

The Indonesian Director of Religious Affairs and a member of the Ministry of Education welcomed Sri Sri at the opening of our Jakarta Ashram. In an inaugural speech, they said they believed Sri Sri's visit would influence the economic crisis in Indonesia. The very next day, the Indonesian currency (Rupiah) was 30% stronger. The devotees from Jakarta have adopted an orphanage in Puncak, which they visit regularly. The director of the orphanage said that while other people bring money, clothes and toys, our group had supplied the missing nutrient the children needed the most : love! The children each received a package of school supplies and goodies. We all laughed, sang and danced as the director cried tears of gratitude. The entourage moved to Singapore where more than 1,000 people welcomed Sri Sri at the packed SLF Auditorium. The evening commenced with a traditional Chinese lion dance; later Sri Sri gave practical points on "Awakening the Beauty Within You."</p>

<p>Cordiality is the core of one's existence, formality is the outer shell. When the outer shell is thin, it can reflect the inner light. Like the dome of the lamp softens the light.

</b><font face="Arial"><p>Do not make an effort to impress others, or to express yourself. Your effort to express yourself becomes an impediment. Your effort to impress someone also becomes futile. If you do not try to impress, expression comes naturally. When you come from the self, your expression is perfect and your impression lasts for ages.</p>
<p>Often you don't seem to have a control over your impressions and expressions. Wisdom is selecting your impressions and expressions. Enlightenment is when you do not take any impressions at all, whether good or bad. Then you "master" the art of expression. Many impressions in the mind cause:</p>
<p>- Confusion</p>
<p>- Distraction</p>
<p>- Chaos</p>
<p>- Lack of focus</p>
<p>- and finally, derangement of the mind.</p>
<p>Nature has inbuilt in us a system through which it releases some of the impressions - through dreams, and through meditation.</p>
<p>Excessive expression loses the depth and luster, the serenity of yourself. Meditation erases the impressions and improves the expression.</p>

The last days, Satsang was graced by the Saints from the neighbouring Ashrams. From Rishikesh, Guruji and the entourage left for Chandigarh. The trip was full of Sri Sri's mischief. On the way, the entourage stopped at the Sikh holy shrine - Paonta Sahib. An enthusiastic Chadigarh team received the entourage past midnight. More than seven thousand people were totally enraptured at the Satsang on the following day. On to Shimla....... </p>

For example: Pesticides and antibiotics were considered to be very useful in the past, and are now proven to be more harmful. In <i>tarka</i>, the paradigm changes.</p>
<i></i><p><i>Vitarka</i> is asking questions to which there are no evident answers....Who am I? Where am I? What do I really want? These philosophically appealing questions bring forth spiritual knowledge, increase your awareness and bring about the blossoming of Consciousness, i.e., <i>Atma Gyan</i> increases.</p>

So, all decision-makers are confused! (Laughter)</p>
<p>Action is spontaneous when there is no actor. In you, there is an actor and there is a witness. An actor is either confused or decisive, but the witness realizes that the action is spontaneous and smiles.</p>
<p>The more decisions you make, the more confused you are, and as a result you swing between pain and pleasure. The more the witness grows in you, the more playful and untouched you are. Trust, faith, love and joy all manifest in and around you.</p>
<p>Are you confused, decided or happy now?</p>
<p>Eberhard: Confusion is too strong of an expression. Is it not rather "choice"?</p>
<p>Urmila: We are decided that choice is confusion. (Everyone laughs)</p>
<p>Hans Peter: Is there any freedom without confusion?</p>
<p>Sri Sri: When you are confused, there is no freedom.</p>

<p>If you lack faith, you have to pray for faith. But to pray, you need faith. This is a paradox. (Laughter)</p>
<p>People have faith in the world - but the whole world is just a soap bubble. People have faith in themselves - but they don't know who they are. People think that they have faith in God - but they have no idea of God. If you want to doubt, you have to doubt everything</p>
<p>There are three types of faith : faith in yourself, faith in the world, and faith in God. You need to have faith in yourself -- without faith, you think, I can't do this. This is not for me. I will never be liberated in this life. You must have faith in the world. Without this, you cant move an inch in the world. Banks give you loans having faith that you will pay it back. You deposit money in the bank having faith that it will be returned. If you doubt everything in the world, nothing will happen. The same is the case with faith in the Divine - have faith in the Divine and you will evolve. All these faiths are connected. You must have all three for each to be strong.</p>
<p>Bill : Atheists have faith in themselves and faith in the world, but not in God.</p>
<p>Sri Sri : They don't have complete faith in themselves. Lack of faith in God, in the world or in the self brings fear. Faith in the world cannot be constant because there are always changes.</p>
<p>Faith makes you full - faithful. If you have faith, you are full. </p>
<p>Rajesh : What is the difference between faith and confidence ? </p>
<p>Sri Sri : Confidence is the result. Faith is the beginning. </p>
<p>Faith in yourself brings freedom.</p>
<p>Faith in the world brings you peace of mind.</p>
<p>Faith in God evokes love in you.</p>
<p>You can be at peace by having faith in the world and without faith in God, but it is not complete peace. If you have love, there is automatically peace and freedom. People who are extremely disturbed should only have faith in God.</p> 		</font>

  		<b></b><p><b>Colourful NEWS SPLASH!</b> At the close of the Tamil Advanced Course, a satsang was held in the late afternoon in the Sumeru Mandap. After several bhajans, Guruji started chanting. Suddenly people started pointing into the western sky where a huge thundercloud appeared, the top of which was filled with brilliant colours of unusual intensity. The trees had been crying for water and within a few minutes, the wind started and it began to rain. What was it? It was not a rainbow. We contacted the weather observatory, but they had no idea of this phenomenon. When we asked the explanation for this, Guruji said, "Nature is our friend".</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Newsplashes - After hectic activities in Bangalore, Guruji tried to escape to Mangalore for 24 hours but it turned out to be another party. Art of Living representatives, headed by Sharada Lavingia were invited to the G -8 Summit reception in Birmingham, U.K. Art of Living was also represented in the World Health Organisation Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Teachers presented programmes in St. Petersburg, Russia. Women's prison programs have started in Bangalore. Reports of more seva projects are arriving from all over the world.</p>

<p>When both God and you are asleep, there is inertia. When the "I" is asleep, there is no experience. </p>

  		<b></b><p><b>NEWSFLASH!</b> A tree planting program was begun at the Bangalore ashram. Guruji met with villagers and inaugurated the 4-H program: health, hygiene, home and human values. Satsang groups were started in the villages around the ashram. Guruji travelled from Bangalore to Bombay which was covered with big billboards. The city Satsang attracted over 5,000. When Guruji and entourage arrived at the airport for the trip to Mauritius, we were told the flight was overbooked and we would have to take a later flight. Guruji showed his "Guru card" and suddenly everything worked and all seven travellers had seats on the plane. </p>
<p>Then on to Mauritius where the volunteers did a wonderful job organising many events: interviews with television and radio, two Satsangs, a lecture at the University, audiences with the president and prime minister, and a visit to an old age home (attended by the Minister of Health and Minister of Women). The local Art of Living society has adopted the old age home as a seva project. During his last visit to Mauritius, Guruji captured the police, and this time he met with wardens and other prison officials. Vikram recorded the Seeds of Wisdom at a local radio station, which will broadcast one quote each day for the next month.</p>
<p>This ends the third year of Weekly Knowledge. </p>
<p>Homework for next week: Everyone individually or in their Satsang groups should write the Knowledge for next week and e-mail it to Bill and Anne at stillpoint@erols.com or fax to 301-854-0080.</p>

</font></b><p><font face="Arial">We Usually Do Only That Which Is Purposeful, Useful, And Rational. Everything You See, You See Through The rational mind. But an intuition, a discovery, new knowledge goes beyond the rational mind. Truth is beyond the rational mind. </font></p><font face="Arial">
<p>The rational mind is like a railroad track that is fixed in grooves. A plane has no tracks. It can fly anywhere. A balloon can float anywhere.</p>
<p>Some people step out of the rational mind in order to rebel against society. They want to break social law but for the ego's sake. They do it out of anger, hatred, rebelliousness, and wanting attention. This is not stepping out of the rational mind (though they think it is).</p>
<p>We step out of the rational mind when we do something that has no purpose. Accepting that, as an act, makes it a game. Life becomes lighter. If you are stuck with only rational acts, life becomes a burden. Suppose you play a game without a thought to winning or losing, just act irrationally. Making an act without any purpose attached to it - it is freedom - like a dance. </p>
<p>So just step out of the rational mind and you will  find a greater freedom, an unfathomable depth, and you willl come face to face with reality. Reality transcends logic and the rational mind. Until you transcend the rational mind you will not get access to creativity and the infinite.</p>
<p>But if you do an irrational act in order to find freedom, then it already has a purpose and a meaning. It is no longer irrational. This knowledge sheet has already spoiled it's own possibility.</p>
<p>Break the barrier of the rational mind and then find freedom for yourself. </p> 		</font>

<p>Here is the solution....FEEL GENEROUS....right away, not tomorrow. </p>
<p>Either a princess or a pauper can feel generous. Generosity is the quality of the spirit. When you feel generous your life becomes abundant, full of compassion and love.</p>
<p>Question: Is generosity the same as being grateful?</p>
<p>Answer: No. Gratefulness always has self concern. You are grateful because you have something or you get something. Generosity is an expression independent of external circumstances. No one can make you feel generous. That is something that you have to do yourself. Essentially, generosity is not an act. It is a state of consciousness, but it cannot but find its expression in an act.</p>
<p>Question: What about passion?</p>
<p>Answer: Passion indicates scarcity. Dispassion is abundance. Dispassion without generosity makes you self-centered, causes more dryness.</p>
<p>You dont� have to think about what you have done in the past. That only brings doership.</p>
<p>Just feel generous. </p>

<b><p>The Path Of Surrender Is The Path Of Love</p>
</b><p>Krishna tells Arjuna, "You are very dear to me."</p>
<p>Then Krishna tells Arjuna he must surrender. Surrender begins with an</p>
<p>assumption. First you must assume. You assume you are the most beloved of the</p>
<p>Divine, and then surrender happens.</p>
<p>Surrender is not an action; it is an assumption. Non-surrender is</p>
<p>ignorance. Non-surrender is an illusion. So surrender is an assumption.</p>
<p>Surrender has to begin as an assumption and then it reveals itself as a</p>
<p>reality. Finally, it reveals itself as an illusion. An illusion because there</p>
<p>is no two, no duality. </p>
<p>There is no independent existence of anyone. An individual has no</p>
<p>independent existence. That is it!</p>
<p>Question: Do you have to go through surrender to realize it is an illusion?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Question: Where is choice then?</p>
<p>Answer: Choice is your destiny.</p>
<p>Krishna doesn't tell Arjuna in the beginning that he must surrender. First</p>
<p>he says, "You are so dear to me." And then he tells him, " There is no other</p>
<p>choice for you, you must surrender. Either you do it now, or you do it later."</p>
<p>This is the path of love. </p>

</font></b><p><font face="Arial">Only in deep rest can the Divine come, not by doing. All the doings are to help you become silent. Not enjoying the bliss or the peace takes you further - otherwise the bliss or the peace can create cravings. If the existence wants to give it, then fine. It takes courage to say "I am". Your true nature is bliss. But trying to enjoy the bliss, you step down from is-ness to am-ness - "l am peaceful", "I am blissful". And that is followed by "I am miserable". "l am" is dispassion. You can be anywhere and be dispassionate. Dispassion is welcoming everything. Centeredness brings energy, a spark. Enjoyment of bliss brings inertia. If you are dispassionate, the bliss is still there. When the freezer is full of ice cream you do not bother about it. Dispassion takes away the sense of scarcity. Passion is a sense of lack of abundance. And whenever everything is abundance, dispassion happens. And when dispassion is there, everything comes in abundance. </font></p><font face="Arial">
<p>Q: What do we do when we catch ourselves enjoying our bliss?</p>
<p>Guruji: Then we feel stupid. Just an understanding we are enjoying it, creates a shift. There is no effort. Knowledge is better than action to make you free.</p>

You don't hear parents say, "l have mercy on my children." You have mercy on those who you think are not yours. Mercy indicates anger, judgment and authority. When you ask for mercy, you are self- centered. You want to be excused from the law of cause and effect. It also indicates lack of courage and valor.</font></p><font face="Arial">
<p>At times mercy is an impediment to growth. Mercy, of course, brings some comfort and relief; but can impair the process of transformation. If the leaves were to ask for mercy from falling, they would not be transformed. </p>
<p>If someone is driving and is tired, they will stop at the rest area. But if they start living there, they will be arrested (laughter). Then the spot has not served its purpose.</p>
<p>Patti and Victoria, high on bliss, did not stop at the stop sign and the police mercilessly gave them a ticket (in India-memo). Do you know what? Victoria said, "Thank you." But the police woman told her to go to court and ask for mercy! (laughter)</p>
<p>When you know and trust the process of creation, you will simply rejoice. It is the small mind which superimposes its nature on the Divine mind. Only when you made a mistake and you think God is angry and judging you do you ever ask for mercy. The Divine is all knowing and all loving; there is no chance for mercy. </p>
<p>Do you know I have no mercy? When there is intimacy there is no place for mercy.</p>

</font></b><font face="Arial"> 
<p align="justify">Loyalty is the way in which a mature and integrated mind behaves. 
  Loyalty indicates undivided wholeness of consciousness and shows richness of 
  the mind. When the mind is not integrated it is feverish, disloyal and opportunistic. 
  Disloyalty comes out of opportunism. Opportunism is short-sightedness of one's 
  destiny. Integrity or wholeness is essential to be healthy. A divided mind will 
  gradually lead to schizophrenia and other physical and mental disorders. Loyalty 
  is a real strength and will have the support of nature in the long run.</p>
<p align="justify">Fear and ambitions are impediments to loyalty. Loyalty is needed 
  both in the material and spiritual plane. Either to destroy, create or maintain 
  any institution, group or society, loyalty is essential.</p>
<p align="justify">Loyalty means believing in the continuity of commitment. Honouring 
  commitment is loyalty. It takes you beyond the duality of craving and aversion.</p>
<p align="justify">Responsibility, dedication, commitment are the limbs of loyalty. 
</p>
<p align="justify">A loyal mind is a 'yes'-mind. The purpose of asking questions 
  is to get an answer. The purpose of all answers is to create a ...'yes'.... 
  'Yes' is an acknowledgement of knowledge. The 'yes'-mind is a quiet, holistic 
  and joyful mind. The 'no'-mind is a agitated, doubting and miserable mind. Loyalty 
  begins with a 'yes'-mind and starts to perish with a 'no'-mind. </p>

  thing. If God is found to be ordinary, just one of us, then your love for God

If love is based on the quality of a person, then the love is not stable - after 
sometime the qualities change and the love becomes shaky. Loving someone because 
of their greatness or uniqueness is Third-rate love. Loving someone because they 
belong to you, great or otherwise, is unconditional love.
</p><p align="justify">Knowledge, Sadhana, Seva and Satsang help to bring about a 
  sense of belonging in no time. When love springs forth from a sense of belongingness 
  then the actions and qualities do not over shadow the love. Neither the qualities 
  nor actions can be perfect all the time. Love and a feeling of kinship alone 
  can be perfect.</p>

<p align="CENTER">Singing, Communication and Ego</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial"> 
<p align="justify">There are three modes of communication: in head to head communication 
  you talk, in heart to heart communication you sing, and soul to soul communication 
  happens in silence.</p>
<p align="justify">When you meet with people, often you communicate from head 
  to head. When you are with nature, you start singing, you communicate with nature 
  from your heart. Often when you are with people you keep talking, blabbering, 
  and you keep the communication on the level of the head only. But when you are 
  with nature, you start humming and your communication comes through the heart. 
  And when you are with the guru, you go blank and forget all the questions. Then 
  communication comes through the soul in silence.</p>
<p align="justify">When you meet with people, you like to remain in the head, 
  you seldom sing with people (other than when it is organised). Your ego obstructs 
  you from singing. Many do not feel comfortable singing with people. When you 
  sing with people then you descend to the heart level or feeling level. Some 
  feel comfortable just listening to music. Some feel comfortable singing only 
  when they are alone. Some sing to draw attention or to charm others. Some only 
  want to join in when all the others are singing. All this singing comes from 
  ego. </p>
<p align="justify">Bhajan means sharing, sharing from the deepest level of our 
  existence. Bhajan is authentic sharing. If you could sing with people, then 
  your ego shatters. Children can sing with people for they do not have ego. To 
  sing with a stranger you have to be free of ego. Ego doesn't let you sing with 
  a stranger. Head level is safe for the ego -heart level breaks the ego - soul 
  level dissolves the ego. All communication gaps happen because of ego.</p>
<p align="justify">Exercise: when you are with people, rather then chatting just 
  start singing and you can feel the shift of energy that is happening. If you 
  want to have more fun, greet a stranger with a song. </p>

<p align="CENTER">EXPANSION OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS PEACE</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial"> 
<p align="justify">Consciousness moving on the surface of the body is stimuli, 
  which cause pleasure. When consciousness shrinks, then the sensation of pain 
  and suffering arises. Suffering is the shrinking or contraction of consciousness.</p>
<p align="justify">When consciousness moves through the body in limited channels, 
  pleasure is experienced. Repeated enjoyment of the stimuli causes inertia and 
  dullness. Often cooks don't enjoy their own food. Listening to the same piece 
  of music loses the charm, people in the sex industry don't enjoy sex. If the 
  stimuli are observed, then consciousness expands and becomes peace. With awareness 
  the stimuli lose their significance; whether they exist or not makes no difference. 
  When the sun is there, then whether the candle is lit or not makes no difference. 
  To realise that all pleasures are just stimuli and that you are more than the 
  stimuli brings freedom.</p>
<p align="justify">Pain is nothing but consciousness wanting to expand and to 
  become free. Freedom basically is liberation from the craving of the stimuli. 
  Pain is not a permanent state. The natural tendency of consciousness is to expand, 
  to become bliss. Like the natural tendency of water is to flow downward, and 
  the natural tendency of air is not to be under pressure, the natural tendency 
  of consciousness is to expand and to be at peace. Like the person who is an 
  insomniac and has forgotten how to sleep, most of us have forgotten to be at 
  peace and in bliss.</p>

<p align="justify"> A beautiful course in the beautiful mountain setting of Norway 
  ... visit to the Tamilian Sri Lankan temple in Oslo ... public lectures in Sweden 
  ... it was always the same: everyone blissfully cried out "please stay longer". 
  Guruji visited Finland for the first time for a total of 15 hours. In this short 
  time, he made the headline news on the main television channel. Several people 
  dreamed of Sri Sri even before hearing about him. Many people signed up for 
  the basic course.In Hamburg, Guruji addressed the oldest Rotary Club of Europe 
  along with a blissful Satsang in a fully packed church which left everyone spell-bound. 
  Welcoming Guruji, the priest said "It is time to open the church doors for real 
  spiritual knowledge". </p>

<b><font face="Arial"> 
<p align="CENTER">DEPENDENCE, INDEPENDENCE, INTERDEPENDENCE AND ONENESS</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial"> 
<p align="justify">The body is dependent on the whole creation. In society, somebody 
  has to make clothes, produce electricity, drill for oil. The body cannot be 
  independent of the world. For the body, dependency is absolute. When the Spirit 
  identifies with the body, then it gets pinched and looks for independence. Mind, 
  intellect, ego - they all look for independence.</p>
<p align="justify">In looking for independence often you get stuck in the ego 
  and become more miserable. Most people are not aware of their dependency. When 
  they become aware of their limitations and dependency, the desire for independence 
  arises. Independence cannot be achieved unless you start moving from within. 
  When you move within, you discover that you are interdependent. Individual Self/Soul/Jeeva 
  is interdependence and in fact every wise person knows that everything is interdependent 
  and that there is nothing like independence. </p>
<p align="justify">On one level dependency is a harsh reality. On another level, 
  it is an illusion because there is nothing else but the Self. It's only when 
  you don't feel oneness, belongingness that you want independence. The Self being 
  non-dual, there is no question of dependence or independence. One who asks for 
  independence is a beggar. One who knows that it is an illusion is a King. When 
  the sense of belongingness is not well founded, then there is a volatile state 
  in the life of a seeker. Then the ego finds some excuse to revert to smallness. 
  It is not yet totally soaked in the totality of knowledge. As it is not used 
  to it, the mind finds every little excuse to revert back to the ego and to be 
  aloof and independent and separate and it would find any small fault and blow 
  it out of proportion. Be aware of these tendencies and come what may, be strong 
  in the commitment to the Satsang, the Path. </p>

<p align="justify"> In the past 240 days, Sri Sri visited 92 places. In the ashram 
  in Germany, TTC1 and TTC2 were in jubilee, the basic course was like an advanced 
  course. Assisted by the official Polish government interpreter, Guruji addressed 
  an enthusiastic audience of 1,700 in Warsaw. Everything was arranged professionally 
  and elegantly. There were about 1,000 people including VIPs and the TV crews 
  who could not get in. It took great skill and effort for the organisers to pacify 
  them. From there 450 people have moved to the scenic Muszyna camp for an advanced 
  course.</p>

  The advanced course in Junagadh had 500 people and was indescribable. Sri Sri 
  attended 4 to 5 Satsangs each day in different part of the city. Excellent teamwork 
  and arrangements made for a electrifying Satsang in Rajkot with over 7000 people. 
  Guruji made a great escape after tearing the decorations, jumping off a wall, 
  getting into his car without his sandals and driving through fields. The latest

  <p><font face="Arial">When one gets an experience, one wants to understand more

  Although "there is no way," Guruji nonetheless gave some interesting clues about 
  "the way" in a spontaneous discourse this week on the eight limbs of yoga. Following

<p align="justify">Sri Sri said: "You have to rejoice in the means. You have to

  when there is no effort, when all activities are shunned." More on this in the 
  next Knowledge sheet.</p>
<p align="justify">Sri Sri theoretically is on vacation this week at the Montreal 
  Ashram. To the untrained eye, however, his so-called vacation appears no different 
  from his usual hectic schedule. Streams of visitors flow through his kutir all 
  day long, and invariably come out beaming. How this happens continues to be 
  the greatest mystery. </p>
<p align="justify">Guruji is visiting Halifax and surprised the devotees of Halifax. 
  Halifax is far from Montreal and many devotees were unable to come to the ashram 
  to see him. Guruji continually confirms in so many ways that he is indeed the 
  embodiment of love and compassion.</p>

<p align="justify">Austerity is often mistaken to be poverty, self-denial. It 
  is neither.<br>
  Austerity comes out of maturity. It is a sign of social health. <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">Often people who practice austerity are resentful of richness. 
  This is a very pitiable state. Such austerity is not born out of maturity but 
  out of compulsion. The true austerity has tolerance for richness and is never 
  resentful.</p>
</font><font face="Arial"> 
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"> In fact, one who is mature will have pity 
  for one who is not austere. Austerity is not against celebration and just vanity 
  is not celebration.</font></p>
<p align="justify">Celebration dawns in the spirit. Only one who is rich in spirit 
  can practice austerity. One may be rich materially but if he is poor in spirit 
  he can neither celebrate nor evolve.</p>
<p align="justify">Poverty of spirit is vanity. Austerity brings freedom from 
  the pride of vanity. But taking pride in austerity is again a vanity !</p>
<p align="justify">Austerity comes out of abundance, and austerity brings abundance. 
  If you feel a lack in any area of life, immediately start austerity. Austerity 
  not only brings freedom but nurtures sharing and caring.</p>

  the Master ecstatically. Thallassery had its first ever Satsang, and Calicut

<p align="CENTER">Uncertainty</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial"> 
<p align="justify">You can be at ease with the uncertainty of the world when you 
  realise the certainty of the consciousness. Often people do just the opposite. 
  They are certain about the things in the world and uncertain about God. They 
  rely on something that is not reliable and get upset. Uncertainty causes craving 
  for stability and the most stable thing in the universe is our Self.<br>
</p>
<p align="justify">The world is of change, the Self is of non-change. You have 
  to rely on the non-change and accept the change. If you are certain that everything 
  is uncertain, then you are liberated. When you are uncertain in ignorance then 
  you become worried and tense. Uncertainty with awareness brings higher states 
  of consciousness and a smile.</p>
</font> <font face="Arial"> 
<p align="justify"> Bharat says: A certain smile!!!</p>
<p align="justify">Often people think that certainty is freedom. If you feel that 
  freedom when you are not certain then that is 'real' freedom. Often your certainty 
  or uncertainty is based on the relative world. To be certain about the uncertainty 
  of the relative, makes you certain about the existence of the absolute and brings 
  a 'certain' faith in the absolute. Nitin says: Yes, to understand this you certainly 
  need to have awareness!!!</p>

        dullness. Uncertainty about the Self creates fear. Uncertainty about matter

  the capital of Kerala where Sri Sri was welcomed with caparisoned elephants, 
  umbrellas and deepa balikas (girls holding lamps) and the King. Over fifteen 
  thousand people were present and yet there was pindrop silence during meditation. 
  The program was telecast live. Then onto Varkala for a morning satsang enroute 
  to Kanyakumari the southernmost tip of India where the three seas meet. The 
  next day the entire town of Udayankulangara celebrated Guruji's brief stopover 
  and a feast was arranged for the entire township. A very famous painter who 
  was making a portrait of Sri Sri for a billboard felt strong currents in his 
  body as he was giving the finishing touches and started crying. He has joined 
  the next Basic course. All the teachers are busy with hundreds taking the course. 
  Throughout Kerala there were arches built welcoming Guruji. Our devotees and

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">After a grand satsang in Madras the group 
  went to the Chidambaram temple, the place of the cosmic dance of SHIVA. Then 
  on to the temple town of Kumbakonam for a big satsang, also known as the seat 
  of Vedic knowledge, where Guruji honored many Vedic pundits and meditations 
  were held in many ancient temples. Then the satsang army marched on to Papanasam, 
  Guruji's birthplace, where everyone played in the water - shooting missiles 
  of bliss. Then on to Trichy for an invigorating satsang. People were well fed 
  up in the temples. In spite of the tour being hectic the whole group of 80 was 
  so energetic and enthusiastic. Guruji was received by the temple authorities 
  at the Sri Rangam temple and honored by the pontiff of the Vaishnava tradition, 
  who was visibly moved. Then the troupe moved on to Madhurai where the elephants 
  garlanded Guruji to the beat of the drums on the premises of the famous Minakshi 
  temple, for a jubilant satsang with more than 8000 people who were spell-bound 
  in a great meditation. Next morning the entire town of Rajapalayam celebrated 
  a long awaited (seven years) satsang with Guruji. Before noon the group left 
  for Udimalpet where many seva projects had been launched. Again a big satsang 
  with several 1000 people. The next morning there was a live kriya and satsang 
  for about 2500 people and the group went to Pollachi for the grand, final satsang 
  of the tour. Then the caravan of buses and cars left for Bangalore and Guruji 
  left for Madras, where a gentlemen came to meet him with an ancient, 5000 year 
  old palm leaf script which mentioned the name of Guruji, and the immense grace 
  that flows through him and protects and transforms the life of millions. Then 
  Guruji came to the European ashram Bad Antogast in Germany. Several advanced 
  courses and seva projects are happening around the world this week - as usual 
  - not to mention the joy and celebration. </font></p>

  	    <b><p align="CENTER">BLISS</p>
</b>
<p>Bliss cannot be understood.  It is extremely difficult to get into bliss.  After many lifetimes you get into bliss. It is even more difficult to get out of bliss.  All that you seek in your life is bliss, that divine union with your source, and everything else in the world distracts you from that goal.  There are a zillion things to distract you from that goal in so many ways.  So many unexplainable, incomprehensible ways of not coming home.</p>

<p>The mind is kept alive by cravings and aversions - shoulds or should nots and wants.  Only when the mind dies does the bliss dawn.  Bliss is the abode of all divinity, all devas.  It is possible only in this human body to comprehend, to uphold, and having had a human life and having known this path, if you still do not realize this - you are at the greatest loss.  The cravings and aversions make your heart hard.  There is no use in being polite in your behavior. You can be rude in your behavior but you cannot be rough in your heart.  If you are rude in your behavior, it is acceptable, but not if you are rough in your heart.  The world does not care how you are inside.  It only looks to your behavior.  The Divine does not care how you are outside � It only looks to your inside.  Never let any tiny bit of dislike or craving house in your heart.  Let it be fresh, soft and fragrant like a rose.</p>

<p>It is such an illusion � you dislike someone or something, and this only makes you hard and your hardness takes a long time to soften, to disappear.  It is such a trap for keeping you away from the treasure.  Nothing in this material world can give you contentment.  An outer-looking mind seeking for contentment gets discontented and the discontentment grows, and complaints and negativity start hardening the brain, clouding the awareness (the aura), and forming a huge cloud of negative energy.  When the negativity reaches its peak, like an overloaded balloon, it bursts and comes back to the Divinity.  You can never escape the Divine, the long route of negativity, or the instantaneous positive approach.  When the Divinity dawns, in no time the shift happens from the untruth to truth, from darkness to light, from the dull inert matter to the sparkling spirit.  When the heart is hard, there is no fun.  You cannot experience fun.</p> 		</font>

Russia reports that the Art of Living course is now a part of the curriculum at the University of Irkutsk in Siberia, Russia.  Guruji's tour of the Netherlands began with a noontime talk at the University of Maastricht to an overcrowded hall with no room to even stand.  The group continued to Amsterdam, where he gave a great talk on Human Values to 140 diplomats, ministers and ambassadors representing 20 countries.  The next evening, a public talk was held in a beautifully decorated hall with melodious music and marvelous meditation and everyone was in bliss.  There was an art exhibit on Human Values and the atmosphere was filled with joy and enthusiasm.  The group then moved on to Rotterdam, where Guruji completed the tour with a talk to the Indian community and everyone present was shining as brightly as decorations.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">WELCOMING AND RESISTING</p>
</b>
<p>Do you welcome all that comes to you or do you resist it? If you cannot resist anything, you cannot welcome anything!   You cannot resist everything and you cannot welcome everything!</p>

<p>You don't welcome all thoughts that come to your mind.  When you welcome a thought, it means you find it good and act on it.  If you act on all thoughts that come to your mind, you will end up in a mental hospital or in prison.  So, you resist or ignore some thoughts and welcome other thoughts.  You need discrimination in life.  Welcoming and resisting is a swing in life.</p>

<p>Welcoming is essential for expansion and growth, and resistance is essential for maintenance.</p>

<p>Audience:  But what you resist persists!</p>

<p>Guruji:  If you resist a cold it does not persist!  If there is no resistance in your body you cannot survive.  Your body resists something and welcomes something.</p>

<p>Where the resistance is weak, the persistence happens.  A weak resistance makes the opposition persist.  A strong resistance erases the opposition.  Strong resistance leads to valour, power and samadhi (equanimity).  It brings in you the strength of a warrior. Nothing can tempt you, nothing can obstruct you.   Then the victory is gained without fighting.  Where there is strong resistance or total welcome, the victory is gained without any fighting.</p> 		</font>

<p>  When a part of the body is stimulated, pleasure arises.  When your soul is stimulated, love arises. Love has no end but pleasure ends.  Often people think pleasure is love.  Distinction between pleasure and love has to be understood, only the luckiest one will understand.</p>

<p>All that one wants is the stimulation of the soul.  Even a faint idea of it keeps life going.  Every other stimulus is on the surface.  The stimulus of the soul energizes and the stimulus of the body brings tiredness.  Every stimulus should lead you to the self so that when you listen to music, you transcend the music, and when you listen to Knowledge it takes you to the Silence.  </p> 		</font>

<p align="CENTER">THE NOISE OF NON-VIOLENCE </p>
</font></b> 
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Often violence comes with noise. Non-violence 
  happens in silence. People who are violent make huge noise; they make it &nbsp;known. 
  &nbsp;People who are non-violent are quiet. But the time has come for people 
  who are non-violent to make noise so that the violence will quiet down. The 
  message of non-violence has to come loud and clear so that it can be heard from 
  a young age. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A sense of shame has to be connected with 
  anger and violence. The reason for violence in young people is a sense of pride 
  in anger and violence, not a sense of shame. People feel proud that they are 
  violent or angry. They think it is prestigious or a status symbol to be aggressive. 
  Aggression is not thought to be a quality to be ashamed of. This promotes aggression 
  and violence in the whole society, and when aggression and violence are promoted, 
  human values diminish. Some movies and modern music glorify frustration, anger 
  and revenge and make these a role model for children.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">We need to promote human values especially 
  love compassion and belongingness loud and clear. Speak to groups or through 
  your local media in the newspaper and on TV and create as many Art Excel and 
  Art of Living courses in your area as possible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The realization that life is very short brings dynamism 
  in your life. Unwanted things will fall off as well as distractions. When you 
  have to be acting or putting out effort, know that life is short. When you are 
  expecting a result, then you are often frustrated. The ignorant person does 
  it the other way: He hurries for the result and is impatient. Impatience goes 
  away when you know that life is eternal. When you are looking for a return of 
  a favor from someone or a result from your good deed, you want it quickly. When 
  you realize life is short, procrastination falls away. But when you know that 
  there are many lifetimes, you realize that if you don't get it sooner, you get 
  it later. Wake up and see your life is too short. Time is running so what are 
  you doing with your life? Is it being useful to you and the world around you? 
  Realize life is too short. WAKE UP! LIFE IS ETERNAL!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><br>
  </font><font face="Arial">When you want to enjoy the fruit of action know that 
  life is eternal. When it comes to hope, you should know that there are many 
  lifetimes. When you are looking for results, know that time is eternal. If someone 
  doesn't thank you or takes advantage of you, thank them because they will pay 
  you back later with interest. So no one needs to feel sorry that they have been 
  taken advantage of or unappreciated. Know that they will have to be paying you 
  back in the future with interest! When it comes to enjoying the fruit of your 
  actions, good deeds or even blessings, know that life is eternal. Anytime that 
  you are in a hurry, you cannot enjoy. So know that life is eternal.</font> </p>

<b><p align="CENTER">FAITH: A QUALITY OF UNDIVIDED CONSCIOUSNESS</p>
</b>
<p>That in which you have faith, do not make it an object of knowing.  Faith is the nature of undivided mind, undivided consciousness.  We have faith in God, do not try to know God.   We have faith in Self, do not try to know Self. You can't have faith in that which you make an object of knowing.  A thing to know is an object of knowing.  You have made it into an object of knowing.  Whatever you have faith in, you do not need to know about it.  Do not make that something you have faith in, an object of knowing.  Like you have faith in God, you cannot make God an object of knowing; like you have faith in yourself, you can't make the Self an object of knowing.<br>
<br>
Q. Are faith and belief the same?<br>
Guruji: Belief is a little diluted, faith is little strong, more concrete.   Our beliefs can change, faith is firm.  Faith is yogurt, belief is buttermilk. (Laughter....)<br>
</p>
<p>Like a child has faith in the mother, the child does not make the mother into an object of knowing.  The child does not try to know the mother, it simply has faith in the mother.  When you have faith, what is the need to know it?  You cannot make love an object of knowing, if you try to make love an object of knowing, if you try to know it, it will disappear.<br>
<br>
In the same way you cannot make Self, or God an object of knowing.  God, love, sleep, and Self are beyond knowing.  If you try to analyze, doubt comes in and faith will disappear.  So whatever you want to have faith in, do not want to know it or analyze it.  The moment you make something an object of knowing then analysis starts and then doubt follows.  Analysis creates a distance, synthesis brings it together.  Faith is synthesis, knowing is analysis.<br>
<br>
Barbara: Can you have faith without being aware of it?<br>
Guruji: Yes. You have faith.  Consciousness cannot exist without faith.  Faith is a relaxed, stable, quality of consciousness.  It is like the flame of a candle.  The nature of consciousness is faith.<br>
<br>
Theologians analyze too much.  They study 5 to 6 years and then they lose their faith.<br>
</p>
</font><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">A story: Jyoti once met an officer in-charge of religious affairs.  The minister was so sure that no one can have spiritual experiences.  She gave him a short talk on spirituality and she concluded by saying,  "I believe in what I experience."  His comment was, "I am glad to hear that you too are an <br>
atheist!"  Another ANALYSIS by a theologian has recently concluded that Jesus never existed.<br>
<br>
Nick: Does God have faith in us?<br>
Guruji: I don't know?!! (Laughter - very non-analytical!!) To know whether God has faith or not, you have to analyze.  If you ask whether God has faith in us then you give God also a mind, which is not true.<br>

<b><p align="CENTER">SUCCESS</p>
</b>
<p>Q.: How was yesterday's program? Was it successful?</p>

<p>Guruji: There is no question of success if you have nothing to gain. There is nothing to gain if you have only come to give and serve.  Success indicates non-supremacy. Success means what?  It indicates that there are chances of failure.  If something is supreme there is nothing to lose.  People running after success only exhibit their limitations.</p>

<p>Success means crossing a limit.  To cross a limit you need to assume that you have a limit.  Assuming a limit is underestimating yourself.  If you have no boundaries then where is your success?  If you have limitless access then there is no success.  You don't say that you successfully drank a glass of water, because it is well within your capabilities.  But when you do something that is beyond your perceived limits you claim success. </p>

<p>When you realise your unboundedness then no action is an achievement.  </p>

<p>Anyone who claims to be successful only reveals his limitation.  If you feel very successful it means that you have underestimated yourself.  All your gains can only be smaller than you.  Taking pride in any gains is belittling yourself. </p>

<p>Sheila: What if you feel that you are not serving successfully?</p>

<p>Guruji: You may feel that you have not done enough but you will not feel that you have not been successful.  Real service is when you feel that you have not done enough.</p>

<p>Kai: You are not very successful! (Laughter)</p>

<p>Guruji: I am just full! </p> 		</font>

<b><p align="CENTER">MESSAGE</p>
</b>
<p>Question:  Guruji, what is your message?</p>

<p>Guruji:  I have no message.  In order to give a message you have to be far away.  Message needs a distance.  Message is of  the past or of the future.  Message is impersonal and lifeless.  Knowledge cannot be a message.  The wise one will not give you a message,  but will simply awaken you.  </p>

<p>God will not give you a message.  For God to give you a message, God has to be so far away from you.  God is more close to you than your breath.  How can He give you a message?  </p>

<p>The wise neither need a message nor give a message.  The unwise would give a message and want a message -- and would be unable to use the message anyway.  Whoever needs the message will not use it.  And one who can use the message wouldn't need it!  </p>

<p>Jim asks,  "What is the difference between Knowledge and message?"</p>

<p>You can read about living in the moment so many times, but it only becomes knowledge when you experience it.  Like you can read the ingredients, but when you taste it, the information becomes Knowledge.</p>

<p>(see last weekҳ Knowledge sheet for the schedule of events)</p>

<p>The 3 day conference being held at the Ashram during the second week of the summer courses will provide the first truly in-depth look into the direction being taken by the  organization addressing our program for children. Unveiled will be the curricula for the ashram School, set to open its doors in autumn of the year 2000, and we will encourage all conference participants to lend us their vision of an ideal school, a school that will be the exact result of the heart-labors put into it by its supporters. So, we are calling on those parents and educators (and generally those interested in the future of our society) to bring their support and their ideas to this conference which proposes to give children the A.R.T. EXCEL experience all-year long.  Please come and share your vision with us. </p>

<p>This conference, being held the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of July,  is offered at no extra fee, and only to those who are here at the Ashram participating in one of the courses taking place during the second week of courses this summer. This is a perfect adjunct to, but not a replacement for, A.R.T. EXCEL Teacher's Training (being held the first week). We are so fortunate to be in the very eye of this storm of knowledge that is right now already transforming the society in which we live. And how fortunate for our children -- the next generation. </p>

<p>Just to keep people abreast of the registration proceedings at the ashram; for the second week the residence building Bodhisattva has been filled, and the two women's cabins have been filled. So bear in mind that when registering, for a fair amount of people, this will mean that you will be registering for either camping or the condos. Please feel free to contact Sage or Judith at the Ashram for more detailed and up-to-the-minute information.</p>
<p>**Special Note: Gurudev has requested that a limit on the number of people coming to the ashram be placed. Therefore, all applications will be handled on a first-come first-served basis and must be accompanied with full payment. Again, please recall that phone messages, faxed messages, or emails will not reserve a place on the summer courses, only the full registration process suffices. Please act quickly to reserve your space. </p>

<p>MAHA SEVA:&nbsp;All people who have any time at all to spare or donations to give are requested to contact the Ashram as quickly as possible in response to Guruji's request that the grounds be cleaned and prepared and generally beautified in order to receive various delegates and honored guests to visit during the time of the summer programs.  </p>

<p>Only a conscious, alert and dynamic person can get bored.  A dull and inert person doesn't get bored.  If you get bored, it indicates you are more alive and human.  It is a sign that you are growing, that you are evolving.</p>

<p>An animal, for example, keeps doing the same thing. It never gets bored.  Cows, horses, birds do the same things over and over all their lives. </p>

<p>People eat, watch television, change jobs, change partners to escape boredom.  And they get frustrated.  And frustration takes them back to inertia and unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Only in two states the boredom does not occur: in a state of total inertia or in a state of Divine Consciousness.  If you are bored, it indicates you are evolving.  Boredom moves you.</p>

<b><p>Volcanic NEWS FLASH  </p>
</b>
<p>Maybe you are bored listening to "the hall was packed" all the time.... Well, in Bogota, Colombia, about 100 people showed up for a morning lecture at the university.  The microphone came at the end and so did most of the people!  About 12 showed up for another university talk, but Guruji was not there.  In contrast, the evening Satsang was so crowded and there was much confusion.  The meditation was reduced to 5 minutes as many had to keep standing.  [McQueen went on strike and refused to write this news flash because it was too factual. (laughter)]</p>

<p>The Dominican Republic's devotion and organizing power pulled Guruji on an 11-hour marathon to reach them.  After his last minute trip to the ocean, Guruji boarded the plane soaking wet.  In Panama the warmth of the Latin-American hearts and songs lit up the Satsangs. In Costa Rica Guruji had a diplomatic reception and a motorcycle escort, and his talk was co-sponsored by  the University of Peace and the National Commission for Human Values. The first Lady, on behalf of the president, received Guruji at the palace and extended her full-hearted support for art of Living activities in Costa Rica. </p>

<p>Guruji was fascinated by the orange fire spewing down the side of the volcano as we drove through the rain forest at midnight. Today the knowledge sheet erupted at the foot of the volcano.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">LOVE AND RENUNCIATION</p>
</b>
<p>Only one who has renounced can truly love.  To the degree you have renounced, to that degree you have the ability to love. </p>

<p>Often people think those who renounce cannot love, and those who love cannot renounce.  This is because so-called renunciants do not seem to be in love, and so-called lovers are very possessive and are in need. </p>

<p>True love is non-possessive and brings freedom, and renunciation is nothing but freedom.  Only in freedom can love fully blossom.  When in love you say, "I want nothing, I just want this."  Renunciation is, " I don't want anything.  I am free."  In love there is no other need. Renunciation is having no need.  Love and renunciation, although appearing to be opposites, are two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>McQueen said -- They are the same side of the same coin. (laughter)</p>
<p>Tara asked -- Does this mean the lover renounces his beloved?</p>
<p>Guruji responded -- You renounce the attachment, the possessiveness.  Renunciation doesn't diminish love; it enhances it.</p>

<p>Only renunciation can sustain love and joy.  Without renunciation love turns into misery, possessiveness, jealousy and anger. Renunciation brings contentment and contentment sustains love.  Without renunciation one gets discontented, frustrated, sad, fearful, suspicious, analytical.  And the whole soap opera begins.  And this is what we find in society ,&nbsp;don't we?</p>

<p>The so-called renunciants have run away from life frustrated and disappointed.  Real renunciation is born out of knowledge and wisdom, knowledge of life in the background of time and space and in the context of this magnanimous universe.</p>

<p>There is nothing new. Everything is the same, meaning everything is changing, 
  everything is re-cycled. Guruji this week has spoken beautifully on the four 
  pillars of knowledge. CBC crews followed Guruji around for two days, and taped 
  a high-energy satsang, complete with wild dancing and Carla's raucous laughter, 
  to be broadcast on national television. Admissions to our schools in India continue 
  to increase. The enrolment in our Bangalore school has grown to more than 700 
  children. Three more schools have been established in under-developed regions 
  in Northern India. </p>

  The time during an eclipse is an auspicious time for doing spiritual practices.

  and more". Misery makes you dense and gross. Self is subtle. To go from gross 
  to subtle you go through the finest relative... the atom. To overcome aversion, 
  hatred, jealousy, attraction or entanglements, you have to go to the atom. Going 
  to the atom means accepting a teeny tiny bit of all this. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It may be difficult to accept something that 
  you don't like but you can definitely accept a teeny tiny bit (an atom) of it. 
  The moment you accept that one atom, you will see change happen. This has to 
  be done in a meditative state.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Suppose you love someone. You want more and

  to you.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Guruji's mother, our beloved AMMA, left her physical body 
  in a peaceful and meditative state at 1p.m. on Nov. 9th, 1999, in Bangalore, 
  just as Guruji set foot in the holy city of Varanasi, precisely as HE had predicted 
  a few days ago. For those present around GURUJI, it was an amazing experience 
  to feel the depth of love and not an iota of grief ! It was a celebration of 
  knowledge, never before experienced! Even as the news came, Guruji kept meeting 
  people and addressed the big Satsang with the same smile as always.<br>
  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">All her life AMMA served with love, humour and dynamism, 
  extending her motherly love to one and all. She had an unparalleled love for 
  GURUJI and shared a unique relationship with HIM - not only as a son but also 
  as a Mentor. Hundreds of people bid a moving farewell to AMMA, singing JAI JAI 
  RADHA RAMAN. AMMA'S mortal ashes were brought to Delhi and GURUJI accompanied 
  them to HARDWAR and immersed them in the Holy Ganges there. A portion of her 
  ashes were also immersed in the river Cauvery, on whose banks AMMA grew up.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">On the 9th of Nov., itself, GURUJI was the chief guest at 
  the consecration of the VISHALAKSHI temple at Varanasi, an invitation that had 
  come two months ago. At this very temple, GURUJI'S grandfather had prayed 70 
  years ago and was blessed with AMMA. Creation returned to it's source as GURUJI 
  reinstalled the very same ancient deity from whom AMMA got her name, on the 
  very same day that she left for her Heavenly abode.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Art of Living family is greatly indebted to AMMA and 
  seek her blessings. The Memorial Service will be on the 21st of November and 
  all Chapters are requested to have Satsangs that day. Through this event the 
  Art of Living has shown to the world that not only Life, but Death also can 
  be a celebration ! </font></p><p align="center"><b><font size="+2"></font></b></p>

  nor death. Yet, in it, flow all the relative events.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><b>Aggression as a means to overcome depression</b></p>
</font> 
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Lack of idealism is the main cause of depression 
  among the youth today. Life appears to be so meaningless to these children, 
  who are either too scared of the competitive world or bogged down by heavy stimuli. 
  They need an inspiration.... <br>
  And Spirituality is that inspiration that can keep the spirit up!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Aggression is the antidote to depression. <br>
  Depression sets in if there is a lack of zeal to fight.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"> Depression is lack of energy, and anger and 
  aggression are a bolt of energy. <br>
  When Arjuna was depressed, Krishna inspired him to fight and thus reinstated 
  life back in Arjuna. If you are depressed, don't take Prozac - just fight - 
  for any cause!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"> If aggression crosses a certain limit it leads 
  you back into depression. That's what happened with King Ashoka, who won the 
  Kalinga war but became depressed. He had to take refuge in Buddha.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">WISE ARE THOSE WHO DO NOT FALL EITHER INTO 
  AGGRESSION OR DEPRESSION.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">That's the golden line of a Yogi. <br>
  Just wake up and acknowledge you are a Yogi!</font></p>

<p align="justify"> <font face="Arial">The two Advanced courses in Rishikesh were 
  simply out of this world. Guruji flew for a day to Bangalore for the memorial 
  service of His most beloved Amma. People had come from from all parts of India 
  to pay homage to the great lady who gave Guruji to this world. Guruji did Aarti 
  to Amma's portrait, singing the same song that Amma used to sing when she did 
  Aarti to Him. Tears flowed from everyone. Guruji shared a few anecdotes about 
  Amma; it is no coincidence that Amma left the body on Yama Dwitiya and the Vaikuntha 
  Samaradhana fell on Vaikuntha Chaturdashi day (the day when Godliness wakes 
  up.) </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Then He flew back to Delhi where He addressed 
  a mind-boggling satsang for thousands. Then on to Indore, where huge cutouts 
  and welcome arches greeted Guruji. The indoor stadium was packed to its capacity 
  of 20,000. The following day saw over 40,000 people spellbound in meditation 
  at the open-air stadium. This was telecast live on local TV. Guruji has devised 
  a new way of giving darshan - all the 40000 were satisfied - guess how!</font></p>

<b><p>NEWS FLASH</p>
</b><p>Mumbai media had big coverage about Gurujiҳ visit there.  The football stadium of Cooperage saw over 50,000 people spellbound in meditation and Satsang.  Everyone was welcomed with sandalwood paste and sweets.  Guruji visited blind women in a shelter named after HIM.</p>

<p>Then on to Cochin in Kerala where an inter-faith convention attended by thousands.  The Imam of Trivandrum and the Bishop of Cochin have praised the Art of Living in elevating Human Values.  Several senior government officials and dignitaries took part in the program.</p>

<p>A traffic policeman in Cochin suddenly got a glimpse of Guruji and started giving wrong signals ("with a blissful smile on his face", Raghu adds).  In the evening, Guruji served dinner for all the volunteers before leaving Kottayam.  Even though there is a political strike throughout Kerala, only Art of Living vehicles are plying smoothly on the roads and only Art of Living satsangs are held as scheduled.</p>

</font><b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p align="CENTER">THE FIVE SECRETS</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial"><p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p>There are five secrets which are sacred and are guarded by the subtle beings and angels in this creation. They are:</p>
<ol>

<li>Jananarahasya (the secret of birth)</li></ol>
<dir>
<dir>

<p>Birth is a secret.  How a soul takes a body, the criteria for selecting the place of birth, time of birth, type of body, parents, etc are all a secret.</p></dir>
</dir>

<p>2.  Maranarahasya (the secret of death)</p><dir>
<dir>

<p>Death is a highly guarded secret.  Death remains a mystery.  The process of separation of spirit from matter and its journey from then on is a secret.</p></dir>
</dir>

<ol start="3">

<li>Rajarahasya (the royal secret, the secret of ruling)</li></ol>
<dir>
<dir>

<p>The principles of governing; the principles of maintaining the orderliness in creation are a secret.</p></dir>
</dir>

<p>4.  Prakritirahasya (the secret of nature)</p><dir>
<dir>

<p>Nature is a mystery. The more you know about nature, the mystery deepens. The more a scientist knows, the more he feels there is much more to know.  Science, though appearing to resolve the mystery in creation, has deepened it. The knowledge of particles, wave functions, black holes, the vacuum state, etc have only deepened the mystery.</p></dir>
</dir>

<p>5.  Mantrarahasya (secret of mantras)</p><dir>
<dir>

<p>The mantras and their effect, influence, method and mode of working are all a mystery.  Mantras are the impulses or rhythms of consciousness, which itself is a mystery.</p>
</dir>
</dir>

<p>Usually in the West, a secret is shameful and dishonest.  But in the East, it is honored and regarded as sacred.</p>

  Tuscany, Italy. As the sun set, they gathered on the shore of the Mediterranean 
  with Guruji chanting Om to say goodbye to the passing millennuim. They were 
  uplifted and inspired by a silent mediation at midnight and Satsang with extemporary 
  bhagans in many languages. Satsangs and New Years Advanced Courses were held 
  around the world in over 93 countries to welcome the New Millennium. </font></p>

  So there was this man who walked his dog every day for 7 years. On this particular 
  day he goes to walk the dog and the dog misbehaves and runs away from him. The 
  dog runs for about 10 minutes. The man finds him standing under a pole announcing 
  the Milano Satsang. So the man sees him standing there and the dog won't move. 
  This forces him to read the poster. He decides that the dog ran all over because 
  the dog wanted the man to see the poster. The man called his friends and told 
  them to come to the Satsang.<br>
  The dog lead the men to the Divine. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Are you evolving? If you are evolving, you

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Broadly they can be put in these 5 catagories. 
  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There are six distortions that do not exist 
  in the Self.</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial"> <i>Expansion -- Prasarana. </i>Expansion indicates there 
    is already something into which something expands. That which expands cannot 
    be the basis for expansion.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><i>Contraction -- Akunchana</i>. Contraction means something 
    shrinks from something else. Self does not withdraw or shrink from anything, 
    so contraction does not exist in the Self.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><i>Evolution -- Vriddhi</i>. Evolution is becoming something 
    which it is not already. Self is the same, so it cannot evolve.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><i>Decay -- Kshaya</i>. There is no devolution or decay 
    in the Self. It doesn't get old or stale. That's why, when you are close to 
    your Self, you don't feel that you are aging.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><i>Beginning -- Anaadi</i>. Self has no beginning. If 
    God has a beginning, then He is no God.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><i>Lack -- Abhava</i>. Self has no lack. Whatever lacks 
    something is not complete. Self does not lack anything, it is complete. Lack 
    indicates existence of something outside itself. That doesn't exist for the 
    Self. So if you feel you have not grown at all, don't worry, you are close 
    to the Self. (Laughter)</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial">When your mind is with the Self, then you don't worry about 
  evolution. If you are thinking about evolving, then you are stuck in the mind. 
  And mind is part of the matter, and matter evolves and decays.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">And that is how the experience of contraction and expansion 
  is all play and display of the mind. Mind expands and contracts. When it expands, 
  it comes close to the truth, which has no expansion. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Are you still evolving? Good luck!!</font></p>

<b><p align="CENTER">FEEL THE PINCH</p>
</b></font><font size="2">
</font><font face="Arial" size="3"><p>A devotee asked Guruji: Please forgive me if I have committed a mistake.</p>

<p>Sri Sri: Why should you be forgiven? You are asking for forgiveness because you feel a pinch and you want to be free from it, isn't it? Let the pinch be there. The pinch will not let the mistake happen again. Forgiveness removes the pinch and you keep repeating the mistake!</p>

<p>Question: How do you know a mistake is a mistake?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: A mistake is something that gives you a pinch. If it hasn't pinched you, it is not a mistake at all. </p>

<p>It is the pinch that irks the consciousness and that pinch disallows the mistake to be repeated. Be with the pinch and not the guilt. It is a very fine balance.</p>

<p>Question: What is the difference between guilt and pinch?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: Guilt is about a specific action and pinch is about a specific result or happening. You can only feel guilty about what you did and not about what happened. But whatever happened, whether because of you or someone else can cause a pinch in you.</p>

<p>Question: How do we get over the guilt?</p>

<p>Tom Gill: Just blame the boss!!! ( laughter)</p>

<p>Sri Sri: Through wisdom, by knowing the nature of mind, nature of consciousness and from a broader perspective of the phenomenon, you can get over the guilt.</p>

<p>Question: Cant we learn from our mistakes without feeling the pinch?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: Learning is at an intellectual level whereas you feel the pinch at an emotional level. The drive of your emotions is much stronger than your intellect. So a pinch will not let the mistake recur.</p>

<p>Bharat: We feel guilt where we have control, it is at the intellectual level, whereas a pinch is at the emotional level where we do not have control.</p>

<p>Question: So, should we discard the intellect?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: You cannot be driven by your emotions alone. Your intellect acts like a brake for your emotions!</p>

<p>Feel the pinch.  </p>
<p>The pinch will create an awareness that what happened was beyond your capacity.</p>
<p>The awareness will bring you to surrender.</p>
<p>Surrender will free you from guilt.</p>
<p>So, from pinch to awareness to surrender to freedom are the steps of evolution. </p> 		</font>

<b><p align="CENTER">SKILL IN PRAISING</p>
</b><p align="CENTER"></p>
<p>Often, when you praise, you praise in comparison to someone else.  In order to praise one person, we put down someone else and when we want to point out somebody's mistake we praise another.</p>

<p>Some are stingy in praising, and some are shy.</p>
<p>And some others are simply not used to.</p>
<p>Some praise with motives, and some others just to elevate.</p>
<p>Others praise themselves in order to hide their low self-esteem.</p>
<p>The real praise dawns in a blossomed state of consciousness.</p>

<p>The praise that comes out of an elevated state of consciousness is simply its nature and is quite different.  Normally praise comes out of craving and pride. The praise from a heightened consciousness is always out of fulfilment. </p>
<p>Praising can no doubt elevate the consciousness and bring enthusiasm and energy.  At the same time it can also bring arrogance.  Praising is a skill. </p>

<p>When someone praises you, do you take it without shying away? </p>
<p>Accepting praise without shyness, is also a skill.</p> 		</font>

<b><p align="CENTER">NEWS FLOOD</p>
</b>
<p>This week we had so much newsthat we are sending just the news flood!</p>
<b>
</b><p>It has been an unusually hectic week even by Sri Sri's standards.  Last Friday, Sri Sri addressed three satsangs in a single day, starting with the rural satsang among thousands of poor people of Inchilla, a brief stopover with the enthusiastic devotees of Belgaum, and on to the urban elite of Goa, with the sound of our bhajans reverberating everywhere.</p>
<p>Ahmedabad was all keyed up as Sri Sri returned after a two-year gap.Teachers from all over Gujarat had been working together to make this the biggest satsang ever.  In the morning, over 25, 000 people did the Sudarshan Kriya conducted "live" by Sri Sri...Intense experiences, strong fragrances, changes in the weather pattern were happening as three eagles circled directly overhead, joined by a flock of other birds �&nbsp;a cosmic rhythm was set in motion. Many people shared that their entire life was one side and this event on the other, such was the magnitude of the experience for them.  Kriya was followed by an elaborate lunch for the participants&nbsp;the network of volunteers had organised 60 counters to feed all of them!  </p>

<p>In the evening, the same cricket stadium was transformed, with a huge lotus designed up in the stands for Guruji to sit in, and video screens all over the grounds. It was a sight to see streams of people flooding in, all excited and happy even before the program began, the crowd totalled nearly 200,000!  The traffic diversion for the event was announced by the traffic police well in advance, as THE event took off without any chaos. </p>

<p>Following 27 minutes of total, still meditation, the entire crowd were on their feet, singing and dancing �&nbsp;the sub-inspector of police remarked that even though a meagre force of 500 was deployed, they had nothing to do, so blissful and orderly was the crowd. The policemen would hug people, and confessed that only their uniform was preventing them from joining the dance. The high priests of the ancient city of Dwarka (Krishna's capital), came all the way to invite Guruji, and placed a resplendent turban (which was from the temple deity) on His head.</p>

<p>The next day was the foundation-laying ceremony of the Gujarat ashram on the banks of the river Mahi.  After a brief satsang in Vidyanagar, Guruji addressed over 3,000 Art Excel kids �&nbsp;it was the best ever question-and-answer session, with witty one-line exchanges between the little ones and the Wise One.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic devotees with a live band awaited Guruji at 4 am in Jamnagar.  Guruji visited the ancient capital of Krishna in Dwarka for a Vishnu Yagna in the ancient Dwarkadheesh Temple. The entire city danced as Guruji was taken in a horse-drawn carriage through the streets of Dwarka's &nbsp;it was a non-stop celebration.</p>

<p>That evening, we had another Divine Satsang in Jamnagar, before returning to Ahmedabad. The blissful ones are now in Delhi, en route to Rishikesh.</p>

<p>PS: The three-year-old daughter of one of our devotees fell from a three-story building recently.  She told her parents later that "That bearded uncle whose photo we have at home He caught me!" She escaped totally unhurt.  (Caution: Please don't try this at home!!)</p>

<p>THIS COMES FROM INDIA:</p>
<p>The Times of India on February 10th came with this article and another about President Clinton's visit to India in March 2000.  In light of the increased awareness of the government of the United States we think that now is the time to awaken all sectors of society to The Art of Living and the projects we are doing around the world, especially our 5H program and our schools in Bangalore, Assam and Bengal.  We would like committees to be formed from Satsang groups to actively participate in contacting their respective Senators and Representatives in each state as soon as possible to convey the vision of the organization and request for full national participation in our service projects in the rural areas of India.  The 5H program involves improvement of the quality of life by addressing Home, Health, Hygiene, Human Values and Harmony in Diversity. For more details about our programs please contact Ajay Tejasvi at ajay_tejasvi@vsnl.com or Dean &amp; Shirley Harmison at Ahimsa108@aol.com.</p></font>

<b><p align="CENTER">FORM AND FORMLESS, AND AGGRESSION AND INTUITION</p>
</b>
<p>A: Form and Formless</p>

<p>Life is a combination of form and formless.</p>
<p>Feelings have no form but their expressions have form.</p>
<p>The Self has no form but its abode has form.</p>
<p>Similarly, wisdom and grace have no form but are expressed through form.</p>
<p>Discarding the formless, you become inert, materialistic and paranoid.</p>
<p>Discarding the form, you become a lost ascetic, a space cadet or an emotional junk!</p>

<p>B: Aggression and Intuition</p>

<p>Aggression and assertiveness overshadow intuition.</p>
<p>Often, people who are sensitive tend to become aggressive in order to avoid being hurt.</p>
<p>In this process, they lose sight of the fine intuition.</p>
<p>Fine intuition needs sensitivity; sensitivity is often painful.</p>
<p>In order to avoid pain one becomes aggressive and assertive, and in turn loses one's intuitive ability.</p>
<p>Intuition is close to the truth.</p>
<p>To be truthful, you don't need to be aggressive and assertive!</p>
<p>Often, aggression and assertiveness thrive on the idea of truthfulness.</p> 		</font>

<p>Some questions can be answered only in Silence.  Silence is the goal of all answers.  If an answer does not silence the mind it is "no" answer.  </p>

<p>Thoughts are not the goal in themselves. Their goal is Silence.  When you ask the question "Who am I?" you get no answer, there is silence.  That is the real answer.  For your soul is solidified silence.  This solidified silence is wisdom, is knowledge. </p>

<p>The easy way to silence the thoughts is to arouse the feelings.  For through feelings only peace, joy and love dawn.  And they are all your very nature.  </p>

<p>To the question "Who am I?" the only relevant answer is silence.  You need to discard all answers in words, including "I am Nothing" or "I am the Cosmic Self" or "I am the Self" - <i>and just stick to the question "Who am I?".  </i>All other answers are just thoughts. Thoughts can never be complete.   Only Silence is complete.</p>

<p>The main impediment of many seekers in the path is that they want to surrender. Don't say that you want to surrender; know that you already are surrendered. </p>

<p>Wanting to surrender becomes an impediment on the path. This is like a child saying to the mother, " I want to love you." No child ever tells the mother," I</p>
<p>want to love you", love is evident there.  </p>

<p>Surrender is not an act, it is a state of your being.  Whether you acknowledge it or not, it is there. The wise wake up and see, the unwise take a longer time. </p>

<p>Know that you have no choice, you are in a state of surrender deep within you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="CENTER">**Anecdotes **</p>
<p align="CENTER"></p>
<p>A four year old child, in an Art Excel meeting, told Sri Sri, " I love you very much." Sri Sri asked, " Why?"  She replied, "Because God has sneaked into your</p>
<p>heart, and you are in God's heart."</p>

<p>In Satsang, a man asked Sri Sri, " I do not feel the need for a Guru. What is your opinion of people like me?"  Sri Sri replied, with a twinkle in his eye, "Don't take my advice!"  ( Laughterũ</p>

<p>(If the person literally does not take the advice, he has done what the Master said, and thus has anyway become a disciple! If the person takes the advice of</p>

<p>When you're in the grip of feverishness about the result of your actions, what do you do?</p>

<p>Faith: Have faith and confidence that the result will be much better than you can ever imagine. With faith you can get rid of feverishness of action/achievement.</p>
<p>Feverishness can also be a hangover from overactivity. Then sleep, listening to flute  music, cold water baths, etc. can help.</p>

<p>Dispassion: Know the whole thing will be over one way or the other, and it doesn't matter. Meditation and breathing can calm you down.  Drop whatever you are doing and do something completely irrelevant, e.g. while decorating your</p>
<p>house, take a moment off to cut grass, or go shopping!  When you are doing something very important, take a moment off to do something totally irrelevant and insignificant. This enhances your creativity.  Relevant action keeps you bound to the action.  Irrelevant action makes life a game!</p> 		</font>

<p>1. A desire arises with the memory of a pleasant experience and past impressions.</p>
<p>2. A desire might arise through listening.</p>
<p>3. A desire can be triggered through the association of certain people and a place.</p>
<p>4. Someone else's need or desire may manifest in you as your own desire, e.g. when someone is hungry, you get a desire to feed them or someone wants to talk to you and you get a desire to talk to them.</p>
<p>5. The destiny or a happening in which you have a part to play may trigger a desire of which you have no idea.

Later he met all the 30 Art of Living teachers and devotees and lauded their contribution to society.  It was a treat to be in that atmosphere of love, laughter and total sense of belongingness. </p>

<p>The second Youth Training Program has begun in Rishikesh with 240 participants. </p>

<p>Of the planned 3000 villages, work is in good progress in 1200 villages.</p>

<p>Today is the Hindu New Year 5101 (52nd Century).  Happy New Year to you all. </p>

<b>
<p>That which shines forth within me, is Rama. </p>
<p>That which is radiant in every particle of the Being is Rama.</p>

</b><p>Rama is born to Dasharatha and Kaushalya.  Dasharatha (In Sanskrit this means "the ten charioted one") signifies the five organs of sense and the five organs of action.  Kaushalya (Sanskrit for "skilled") stands for skill. The skillful reiner of the ten chariots can give birth to Ram.  When the ten are used skillfully, radiance is born within. </p>

<p>Rama was born in Ayodhya (Sanskrit for "the place where no war can happen"). When there is no conflict in our mind, then the radiance can dawn.</p>

<p>Lakshmana, the brother of Rama, was born of Sumitra �&nbsp;the good friend.  When the ten are cooperating with you then Awareness is born.</p>

<p>Often we try to look for radiance within.  Just realize that you are radiant.  Once when Guruji was 5 or 6 years old, he closed his eyes and asked a visiting saint, "Swamiji, I do not see any light".  The saint replied, "You are the light!  How can you see the light?"</p> 		</font>

<p>No person, animal or creature desiring unhappiness is ever born, never has it happened before and never will it happen in the future. </p>

<b><p align="CENTER">YOU ARE NOTHING!</p>
</b>
<p>Each experience completes.  Completion means leading to void or nothing.  In the progression of life, you will leave behind every experience saying, "This is nothing."  Anything that is completed loses its importance.  That is to say it leads you to void - this is nothing.</p>

<p>A sign of intelligence is how soon you arrive at this understanding.  Examine everything in life and say "This is nothing" and what remains after all that is Love, and that is everything.</p>

<p>When "This is nothing" does not come out of knowledge, it comes out of misery.  Either through knowledge or through misery, you come to the point of "This is nothing, this is nothing".  The choice is yours.</p>

<p>If you got this, it is really NOTHING, If you didn't get this, never mind - this is nothing. (laughter)</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">DESIRE FOR TRUTH</p>
</b>
<p>Buddha said that desire is the cause of all misery.  If your desire does not get fulfilled, it leads to frustration and causes misery.  Even if it does get fulfilled, it leaves you empty.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Vasishta said that desire is the cause of pleasure.  You get pleasure from an object or a person only when you desire them.  When you do not desire an object, you do not get pleasure from it.  For example, when a person is hot and thirsty, a sip of cold water gives him pleasure; but not if he is not thirsty.   Whatever gives you pleasure binds you and bondage is misery.</p>

<p>Sri Sri says when you desire for truth, all other desires drop off.  You always desire for something that is not there.  But, truth is always there!  Desire for truth removes all other desires and it itself dissolves.  And what remains is bliss. </p> 		</font>

<b><p align="CENTER">EDUCATION</p>
</b><p> Education has five aspects</p>

<p>1. Information  -- Often we think information is education, but it is only one aspect of education. </p>

<p>2. Concepts -- Concepts are the basis for all research. You need to conceive in order to create.</p>

<p>3. Attitude -- An integral aspect of education is cultivating the right attitude. Proper attitude at the right time and place determines your actions and behavior. </p>

<p>4. Imagination -- Imagination is essential for creativity, for the arts. But if you get stuck in imagination, you may become psychotic.</p>

<p>5. Freedom -- Freedom is your very nature. Only with freedom, do joy, generosity and other human values blossom. Without freedom, attitudes become stifling, concepts become a burden, information is of no value and imagination becomes stagnant.</p>

</font><b><font face="Arial"><p align="CENTER">HOW TO DEAL WITH HUMILIATION?</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial">
<p>Know that humiliation does not weaken you -- it strengthens you.</p>

<p>When you have a sense of belongingness, you don't feel humiliated.  The more egotistic you are, the more humiliation you feel.  When you are childlike and have a greater sense of kinship then you don't feel humiliated.</p>

<p>When you are committed to truth and not to your ego then you also don't feel humiliated. </p>

<p>If you are afraid of humiliation, you can neither make progress in your material life nor in your spiritual life.  When you stand above humiliation, you get closer to the Self - to God. When you are steeped in love, with the Existence, with the Divine, nothing whatsoever can humiliate you.</p>

<p>So, the way out of humiliation is:</p>
<p>Get humiliated!</p>
<p>Be childlike</p>
<p>Be crazy</p>
<p>Get steeped in love with the Divine</p>
<p>Total commitment to Truth-Knowledge</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A person who argues should not be given knowledge. An argumentative mind is not receptive to knowledge. When someone is in an argumentative mood, then giving knowledge or advice is in vain. In an argumentative mood you feel you know it all. Then you are not ready for knowledge. That is why wise people do not give advice when they are in an argumentative environment. </p>

<p>Argument has a purpose. It can bring out the truth if there is no emotion or sense of "I" attached to it. Argument can also have a disadvantage. It can make untruth appear to be truth. </p>

<p>A wise man will not take arguments seriously; he will just have fun with them. Wisdom is beyond all arguments.</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>Both a worldly person and a spiritual person will tell you not to do wrong, though the reasons they give are totally different. A worldly person will tell you not to do wrong because it hurts or causes him pain. A spiritual person will tell you not to do wrong because it would only harm you more. </p>

<i><p>Exercise</p>
</i><p>Identify any one specific virtue or good quality you would like to have. Ask for it on Guru Purnima day (the full moon - July 15-16) and know that you have it. </p>

<p>Virtues cannot be cultivated. You have to assume that they are there.</p>

<p>The seeker should remember that he is born with virtues; otherwise he could not have been a seeker. </p>

<p>If you think you do not have virtues and then try to cultivate them, you will fail.</p>

<p>You often compare yourself with others on the basis of virtues. Do not compare yourself with them. Simply recognize all the virtues you appreciate in others, and realize that they are already present in you in seed form. You only have to nurture them.</p>

<p>When you think you do not have a virtue, then you come from a space of lack or deficiency. </p>

<p>Caroline: Aho! That is why we don't need positive affirmations!</p>

<p>Alice: Affirmations really don't work anyway.</p>

<p>Sri Sri: Affirmations do not work because you think you do not have those virtues, and with affirmation you try to have them.</p>

<p>And so Caroline affirms: You are the home of all virtues. (laughter)</p> 		</font>

<p>Action is out of conscious decision. Reaction is out of impulsiveness.</p>

<p>non-action can create karma.</p>

<p>For example, a soldier shooting in war does not create a karma; a policeman using tear gas does not create a Karma, and if you are a doctor and you do not give medicine to a patient in need, you are incurring a karma.</p>

<p>The purpose of technology is to harness nature to bring information and comfort to human beings. When spiritual values - human values - are ignored and</p>

<p>Technology without human values would see nature as a dead object. Science gives an insight into the life of nature and spirituality makes the nature come alive.</p>

</b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a congregation, Sri Sri asked, " How many of you are feeling strong?" Many people raised their hands.</p>

<p>Sri Sri : "Why?"</p>

<p>Because YOU are with us!!!</p>

<p>Sri Sri : "Only those who feel weak can surrender".</p>

<p>All those who were feeling strong were taken aback!</p>

<p>If you are in love, you feel weak because love makes you weak. Yet there is no power stronger than love. Love is strength. (All those who had raised their hands for strong&nbsp;suddenly felt weak!). Yet love is the greatest power on earth. You feel absolutely powerful when you are with the Divine.</p>

<p>Someone asked: "But why do we keep alternating between the two?"</p>

<p>Sri Sri: "That is the fluctuation in life."</p>

<p>				CONFLICT AND INNOCENCE</p>
</b>
<p>Fights can only happen among equals. When you fight with someone, you make them equal. But in reality there is no one at par with you. When you keep people either above or below you, then there is no fight. </p>

<p>When they are above you, you respect them. </p>

<p>When they are below you, you love them and you feel compassionate.</p>

<p>Either submission or compassion can take you out of a fight in no time. This is one way to look at it when you are tired of fighting. When you are well rested, just fight and have fun. </p>

<p>The same is true of the mind. As long as the mind thinks it is equal to the senses, there is conflict. When it realizes that it is bigger than the senses, there is no conflict. And when the mind is smaller than the senses, like in animals, there is no conflict. When the mind is caught up in the senses, there is constant conflict. When it transcends the senses, it comes back to its true nature, which is innocence - in no sense. </p>

<p>Does this make sense? (Laughter)</p>

</b>
<p>When you are on a spiritual path, you are not thankful or obliged to anybody. In the Gita, Krishna says, "He is dear to Me who neither goes on thanking people nor hates anyone (Na abhinandati na dveshthi)." </p>

<p>Thanking and feeling obliged indicates that you believe in some one else's existence rather than in the Divine who is ruling everything. When you feel obliged, then you are not honoring the principles of karma or the divine plan.</p>

<p>Appreciate people for what they are, do not thank them for what they do. Otherwise your thankfulness is centered around ego. You are grateful, but not for an act. You are grateful for what is. As every individual is nothing but a puppet of the ONE, thanking and being obliged is simply an exhibition of ignorance.  Everything is ruled, controlled and managed by one Divinity, that consciousness has to shine forth in every act of yours; you do not have to make a mood of it.  </p>

<p>Q: Guruji, we are so grateful to you, what should we do?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: When you have a total sense of belonging, then gratefulness does not become an obligation. Such gratefulness is for the Divine only, which enhances strength. </p> 		</font>

</b><p>How would you like to see yourself&nbsp;happy and bubbling with enthusiasm or dull and difficult to please?</p>

<p>Often you like to be pleased, appeased and cajoled. So you put up a tough, upset face and act difficult to please. If a person has to appease and please ten people all the time, it will be so tiring. People who keep a long face and expect others to cajole and appease them make others run away. Lovers often do this. They expend a lot of energy in cajoling and this brings down the joy and celebration of the moment. </p>

<p>It is okay for you to show your upset mood or tendency once in a while, but doing it over and over again is taxing for you and people you love. </p>

<p>If you feel down, appease and please yourself. Your need to be appeased by someone else is the sign of grossness. This is the root of ignorance. If you want attention, all you get is tension. </p>

<p>Become one whose enthusiasm never dies, come what may.</p>

<p>It is not possible to attain Divine Love with a complaining face. The complaining face is a sign of an unaware mind. If you want to complain, complain to God or your Guru because both have their ears covered. (Laughter)</p> 		</font>

<b><p align="CENTER">DEVOTEE BECOMES GOD</p>
</b>
<p>When a river meets the ocean, the river no longer remains a river. It becomes the ocean. A drop of the ocean is part of the ocean. In the same way, the moment a devotee meets (surrenders to) the Divine, the devotee becomes GOD. When the river meets the ocean, it recognizes that it is the ocean from the beginning to the end. Similarly, the individual "IŮ IŮ" dissolves in ONE Divinity.</p>

<p>Question: What about backwaters?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: Sometimes the ocean goes into the river to greet it. Sometimes it seems that the ocean is pushing back the river. Similarly, the Divine puts many questions and doubts in the mind or gives an amazing experience to bring one back home.</p>

<p>One who is not amazed by the magnificence of this Creation,&nbsp;his eyes are not yet opened. Once your eyes are open, they close and this is called meditation. (Laughter)</p>

<p>Tell me, what in this Creation? Is not a mystery?</p>
<p>Birth is a mystery; death is a mystery.</p>
<p>If both birth and death are mysterious, then life is certainly a greater mystery. Isn't it?</p>
<p>Being completely immersed in the mystery of Life and this Creation is Samadhi.</p>

<p>Your knowing or believing doesn't really matter to what Is.</p>
<p>This Creation is an unfathomable secret, and its mysteries only deepen.</p>
<p>Getting steeped in mystery is Devotion.</p>
<p>The "Scene" is a mystery; the "Seer" is a mystery.</p>
<p>Deepening the mystery of Creation is science.</p>
<p>Deepening the mystery of the Self is spirituality.</p>
<p>They are the two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>If neither Science nor Spirituality can create wonder and devotion in you, then you are in deep slumber.</p>

<p>Knowledge Tidbits:</p>

<p>When a materialistic person tells you a secret, it will only create doubts and spread malaise.</p>
<p>When a wise or spiritual person tells you a secret, it will uplift your consciousness and spread benevolence.</p> 		</font>

<b><p align="CENTER">PERFECTION IS THE NATURE OF THE ENLIGHTENED ONE</p>
</b>
<p>In a state of ignorance, imperfection is natural and perfection is an effort. </p>
<p>In a state of wisdom or enlightenment, imperfection is an effort; perfection is a compulsion and is unavoidable! </p>
<p>Perfection is taking total responsibility, and total responsibility means knowing that you are the only responsible person in the whole world. When you think that others are responsible, then your degree of responsibility diminishes. </p>
<p>When you are in total Vairagya (dispassion), you can take care of even trivial and insignificant things with such perfection. For example, during the Pooja every morning, Guruji decorates the Pooja table with flowers with such great care, choosing different color combinations and patterns everyday; fully knowing that the decoration is not going to last even 10 minutes. After the Pooja He himself would remove the garlands from the Pooja table or shower people with the flowers on it. Yet even while He is in a deep state of Samadhi, He would effortlessly and lovingly decorate the Pooja table everyday. It is obvious that it does not matter how the flowers are kept, but still attention to even such a trivial thing with such keenness of awareness can only come through utter dispassion. </p>
<p>Perfection is the very nature of the Enlightened one.</p> 		</font>

<p>When you love something, you have a sense of belongingness with it. You can only love something, because it is belongs to you. If it is not yours, you cannot love it. Love is the shadow of the Self. </p>

<p align="CENTER">The bigger the Self, the bigger the shadow, and the bigger the love.</p>

</b><p>Deepawali happens.</p>
<p>Today is Deepawali, the festival of lights. There are many stories associated with this day.</p>
<p>It was this day that the demon Narakasaura was killed. King Narakasura (Naraka means hell) had been granted a boon that he could be destroyed only by a woman. Lord Krishnaҳ wife Satyabhama was the one to destroy him.</p>

<p>Why only Satyabhama could kill Naraka? Satya means truth and bhama means the beloved. Untruth or lack of love cannot conquer hell.&nbsp; It cannot be removed by aggression. Hell can only be erased by love and surrender. Non-aggression, love and surrender are the inherent qualities of a woman. Hence only Satyabhama, the true beloved could remove hell and bring the light back. And Narakasuraҳ last wish was that every house should celebrate his exit with lights to mark the end of darkness. This is Deepawali.</p>

<p>Also it was today that Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya, his Kingdom, after his victory over Ravana, the demon king. Ayodhya means that which cannot be destroyed, i.e. life. Ram means the Atma (the Self). When Self rules in life, then knowledge lights up. There is life everywhere. But when the spirit is awakened in life, deepawali happens.</p> 		</font>

<p>What is the difference between a tourist and a pilgrim? </p>

<p>Both are on a journey.&nbsp; Whereas a tourist is satisfying the senses, a pilgrim is in the quest of the truth. A tourist gets tired and tanned, while a pilgrim sparkles with spirit. Every move a pilgrim makes is with sacredness and gratitude, while a tourist is often preoccupied and unaware. </p>

<p>A tourist compares with other experiences and places and hence is not in the present moment. But a pilgrim has a sense of sacredness, so he tends to be in the present moment. </p>

<p>Most people in life are just tourists without even being aware of it. Only a few make their life a pilgrimage. Tourists come, look around, take pictures in their mind, only to come back again.  Pilgrims are at home everywhere and are hollow and empty.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When you consider life as sacred, nature waits on you. </p>

<p>Guruji was a State Guest in Orissa where he arrived after a brief Satsang in Chennai. Guruji went to Jagannath Puri, the Eastern seat of wisdom, where Vishnu Yagna was performed. Puri had a great satsang, where many people reported miraculous healing experiences. Report from Argentina tells us about the stunning experience of the medical team on the miraculous</p>
<p>disappearance of a malignant tumor where the patient was given 48 hours to live.</p>

<p>Though it was the first time in Orissa, the arrangements and the enthusiasm were simply unmatchable as Guruji mesmerized a crowd of more than 35,000 people.</p>

</b>
<p>When you are neither clear nor confused, only then can you be a perfect instrument of the Divine! How would an instrument know what is going to be, and when? How can an instrument be confused, and how can an instrument be clear!</p>

<p>This state is called Nimit - just being an instrument of the Divine. Being very clear means not opening to new possibilities and can lead to limitations. Unlimited possibilities are open to one who is not clear and not confused.</p>

<p>Your mind swings from clarity to confusion and confusion to clarity but the state in which there is no doership nor inertia is the most creative and progressive state.</p>

<p>Sharmila: Will this not lead to lethargy?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: No. A sharp instrument does its job perfectly, effortlessly.</p>

<p>Sharmila: What about focus?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: Focus is natural to a dynamic consciousness.</p>

<p>Confusion arises when new information flows in and clarity is lost. Then confusion again seeks clarity. Clarity constricts the possibility of new information. A confused consciousness seeks clarity and every confusion is breaking away from clarity.</p>

<p>If there is only confusion, there is frustration. If there is only clarity, there is rigidity.</p>

<p>After giving contradictory knowledge, Krishna tells Arjuna, "Just be Nimit!" And to be an instrument, the prerequisite is to be madly in love! That's why in love there is neither confusion nor clarity; or there is both - confusion and clarity!</p>

<p>Nazreen: Is truth more important than love?</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">THE PROBLEM'S SOLUTION</p>
</b>
<p>Whenever there is a problem we either deny it saying there is no problem or sit to solve the problem and make it a big issue. Neither of these help. A problem does not disappear when you deny it. And it does not get solved when you sit to solve it.</p>

<p>The 5 steps to solve a problem:</p>
<p>1. Acknowledge the problem - it is there.</p>
<p>2. See it as a small problem, and do not say it is big.</p>
<p>3. If it concerns people, keep in touch with them instead of avoiding them.</p>
<p>4. Talk less and give time a chance.</p>
<p>5. Get together and celebrate. When you celebrate and put the problem on the back burner you will see that the problem will get solved by the way.</p>

<p>So it is wise not to sit to solve a problem. Most of the meetings to solve problems end up in disaster.</p>

<p>If you do not have any problem, you will create problems for others! (laughter) If you have a small problem in your pocket to solve, it will give a focus to your mind. If you do not have any problems, you may be a problem for others.</p>

  	    <b><p align="CENTER">SACREDNESS AND YOU</p>
</b>
<p>Throughout the ages, in all cultures, place, time, persons and symbols were all considered sacred. Whenever you consider a symbol, place, time, person or act sacred, your attention is undivided and whole. When things are ordinary and same, you tend to slip into unawareness and inertia. The moment you consider something sacred, your inertia disappears and you become more alive. There is nothing as fulfilling as a sacred act. You put your heart and soul in a sacred act. When every action of yours becomes sacred, you have become one with the Divine. Then every minute of your life is sacred, every place you go to becomes sacred, every person you meet is only your reflection, and every act of yours is sacred.</p>

<p>Question: Why does an act when performed repeatedly lose it sacredness? </p>
</font><font size="3">
</font><font face="Arial" size="3"><p>Sri Sri: This happens when your memory overpowers your consciousness and you lose your sensitivity. For example, people living in Benares do not feel that it is a sacred place. That sensitivity is just not there.</p>

<p>Question: How can we preserve that feeling of sacredness in our acts?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: Through living in the present moment and through Sadhana. Your Sadhana will not allow your memory to overpower consciousness. Repetition is not a hindrance then.</p>

<p>The Native American Indians and the tribals consider the earth, sun, moon and all the directions as sacred. In the ancient tradition, the Rishis considered all the rivers, mountains and even animals, trees and herbs as sacred. What to say of people? They are definitely sacred!</p>

<p>In different parts of the world, certain symbols, certain places and different times of the year are considered sacred. Various cultures honor certain people and consider them as sacred. For example, Christians consider the Cross, Jerusalem, Christmas and the Pope as sacred. For Muslims, the Crescent Moon, Mecca and the month of Ramadan are sacred. The Hindus consider the river Ganges, the Himalayas and the Swamis as sacred.</p>

<p>It is good to begin feeling that some symbols, places, time and people are sacred so that you can be awake and alive. But eventually you need to transcend and feel that the entire creation and your whole life is sacred. For the man of God, the whole world, with all its symbols, places and people are sacred at all times.</p>

<p>Guruji presented the Human Values Award 2000 to Max van der Stoel,&nbsp;the OSCE High Commissioner on national minorities, at the International Association for Human Values Conference in Amsterdam, Holland. The conference was attended&nbsp;by several dignitaries, including the former prime minister of the Netherlands who was one of the keynote speakers. Guruji left an indelible mark in Amsterdam. A well organized Satsang with many intelligent questions and knowledge flowing from the Master left the packed hall spellbound and asking for more.</p>

<p>It was thought that to say, "I am God" is blasphemy.&nbsp; I tell you, to say "I am not God" is blasphemy!  When you say,&nbsp;"I am not God,"&nbsp;you deny God of His omnipresence.</p>

<p>You are made up of love.&nbsp; If you say, "I am not God," you are denying that God is love. If you are love and you say, "I am not God," you are saying God is not love, and that is blasphemy. </p>

<p>"I am" is your consciousness. If you say, "I am not God," you deny that God is aware, alert and awake.&nbsp; You exist. When you say, "I am not God," you deny God of a portion of existence, and that is blasphemy.&nbsp; Also, you are denying the scriptures that say, "God made man in His own image."  If you say, "I am not God," you are denying God. </p>

<p>Question:&nbsp; If God is omnipresent, why is there hatred and suffering in this world?</p>

<p>Sri Sri:&nbsp; Just as in a movie, it doesn't matter whether it is a tragedy or a comedy, or one with a happy ending; in the Absolute there are no opposites. All the opposites are part of&nbsp;relative existence. </p>

<p>Relative existence&nbsp;is not the complete picture. Good and bad, right and wrong, everything is relative. For example, milk is good, but too much milk can kill you. A drop of poison can save a life (most medicines have "POISON" written on them). These are neither absolutely good nor bad; they are just there.</p>

<p>Truth transcends duality, and God is the absolute and only truth. In a movie, when light passes through the film, it doesn't matter to the light what the film is. Tragedy or comedy, hero or villain, the light is always there.</p>

</font><font face="Arial"><p>It is difficult to see God as formless and it is difficult to see God as form. The formless is so abstract and God in a form appears to be too limited. So some people prefer to be atheists.  </p>

<p>Atheism is not a reality, it is just a matter of convenience. When you have a spirit of enquiry, or in search of truth, atheism falls apart. With a spirit of enquiry, you cannot deny something which you have not disproved. An atheist denies God without first disproving it. In order to disprove God, you must have enormous knowledge. And when you have enormous knowledge, you cannot disprove it! (laughter!)For one to say that something does not exist, one should know about the whole universe. So you can never be one hundred percent atheist. An atheist is only a believer who is sleeping!</p>

<p>For a person to say, "I don't believe in anything", means he must believe in himself - so he believes in himself about whom he does not even know!</p>

<p>An atheist can never be sincere because sincerity needs depth - and an atheist refuses to go to his depth. Because the deeper he goes, he finds a void, a field of all possibilities - he has to accept that there are many secrets he does not know. He would then need to acknowledge his ignorance, which he refuses to do, because the moment he is sincere, he seriously starts doubting his atheism. A doubt-free atheist is next to impossible! So you can never be a sincere and doubt-free atheist. </p>

<p>When the atheist realizes his ignorance, what does he do? Where does he go? Does he go to a Guru? What does a Guru do to him? (Wait for next week's knowledge!)</p> 		</font>

<b><p align="CENTER">ATHEISM</p>
</b>
<p>Atheism is when one does not believe either in values or in the abstract. When an atheist comes to the Guru, what happens? You start experiencing your own form and discover that you are indeed formless, hollow and empty. And this abstract non-form in you becomes more and more concrete!!!</p>

<p>The guru makes the abstract more real and what you thought as solid appears to be more unreal. Sensitivity and subtlety dawns. Perception of love, not as an emotion, but as the substratum of existence becomes evident. The formless spirit shines through every form in creation and mystery of life deepens, shattering the atheism. Then the journey begins and it has four stages.</p>

<p>The first stage is Saarupya (to see the formless in the form) �&nbsp;Seeing God in all the forms. Often, one feels more comfortable to see God as formless rather than with a form, because with a form, one feels a distance, a duality, a fear of rejection and other limitations. In life all of our interactions are with the form, other than in deep sleep and in Samadhi. And, if you do not see God in the form, then the waking part of life remains devoid of the Divine. All those who accept God to be formless use symbols, and perhaps love the symbols more than God himself! If God comes and tells a Christian to leave the cross or a Muslim to drop the crescent, perhaps he may not do it! To begin with loving the formless is possible only through forms.</p>

<p>The second stage is Saamipya (closeness) �&nbsp;feeling absolutely close to the form you have chosen and reaching out to the formless. This leads to a sense of intimacy with the whole creation. In this stage, one overcomes the fear of rejection and other fears. But this is time and space bound.</p>

<p>The third stage is Saanidhya - feeling the presence of the Divine by which you transcend the limitations of time and space.</p>

<p>Then the final stage �&nbsp;Saayujya �&nbsp;is when you are firmly entrenched with the Divine. It is then you realize you are one with the Divine. There is a total merging with the Beloved and all duality disappears.</p>

<p>THIS IS THAT AND THAT IS THIS.</p>

<p>Vinod Mathur: Does a believer also go through these four stages?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: Certainly, whether an atheist or believer, he goes through the four stages.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">TO SAY SORRY IS A GOOD MISTAKE?</p>
</b>
<p>Often, in establishing your righteousness, you are insensitive to others�&nbsp;feelings. When someone is hurt, arguing with them and establishing your righteousness will be in vain. By saying a simple "Sorry", you can uplift the other and take away the bitterness. In many situations saying "Sorry" is better than establishing your righteousness. It can avert much unpleasantness. </p>

<p>This one word of five letters, when said sincerely can remove anger, guilt, hatred and distance.</p>

<p>Many people feel pride in hearing "Sorry" from others. This boosts their ego. But when you say "Sorry" to a wise man, it evokes compassion at your ignorance. However, when you say "Sorry" to your Guru, He will get angry and say, "Go! Listen to Ashtavakra!" (Laughter) For your saying "Sorry" indicates doership. You feel that YOU have MADE a mistake.</p>

<p>A mistake is part of an unconscious mind. An unconscious mind cannot do right. A conscious mind can do no wrong. The mind which makes the mistake and the mind which realizes the mistake - saying "Sorry" - are entirely different, arenҴ they? The mind which says "Sorry" cannot be an unconscious mind. Therefore, saying "Sorry" sincerely is a BIG MISTAKE!!!</p>

<p>Did you get it or are you confused? If you didn't get it, don't feel sorry orŹou can feel sorry!! (Laughter)</p>

The ashram, deep in snow that sparkles like diamonds, seems suitably decked out to receive Guruji on this first winter visit. The frozen lakes provide great 'skating' on afternoon walks (runs!) through the snow. </p>

<p>The City Council in Alpharetta, Georgia, USA, planned to remove several 150-year old oak trees as part of a street-widening project. The engineering firm, cable company, and phone company made their studies and gave approval. Local people who wanted to save the trees were told, "There's no hope; it's finished."  A devotee put Guruji's picture on each tree and phoned the city officials to tell them the trees were protected by a saint. Word spread through the town and 300 protestors, along with full media coverage, showed up at the City Council. Plans were abandoned, and the trees are happily standing.</p></font>

<p>So many people are stuck with what is "important". Why do you always have to do only that which is important? Most people are caught up thinking about what is important.</p>

<p>For something to be important, there need to be many things that are unimportant. So you cannot eliminate unimportant things. It is important to have unimportant things to make something else important. (Laughter.) Things are either themselves important or they make other things important. So that means everything is important, and. everything is unimportant.</p>

<p>When you realize this fact you become choiceless.</p>

<p>When you say something is important you are limiting your vastness.</p>

<p>A journalist asked me, "Why is it important to breathe?" "Why is it important to be happy?" "Why is it important to have peace?" These questions are not relevant at all. Why should you always look for what is important? Something that is unimportant can contribute to something that is important. And what is important and unimportant changes with time and space. Food is important when you are hungry and unimportant when you are full. </p>

<p>When something is inevitable you don't categorize it as important or unimportant. It is beyond choice.</p>

<p>"Everything is important" is karma yoga. "Nothing is important" is deep meditation.</p> 		</font>

<p>Two African countries, Benin and Togo, have entered the Art of Living family - bringing the total number to 112.</p>

<p>A Montreal devotee who is a cab driver by profession picked up a passenger one night who appeared overcome by drugs and alcohol. The passenger demanded to be taken to his destination for half-fare, and when the driver protested he pulled a gun. At first the driver was afraid, but when he looked at the photo of Gurudev on the dashboard he felt completely protected. During the drive, the passenger put the gun away. Eventually he asked&nbsp; who was the person in the photo. When they reached the destination, the passenger bowed to the picture and paid the driver the full fare along with a handsome tip.</p>

<b><p align="CENTER">WORSHIP A SIGN OF MATURITY</p>
</b>
<p>For a flame to go up, you need space above. In the same way, for a man to rise up in his life, he needs an ideal, he needs something to adore and worship. Worship is the culmination of love and appreciation. Worship prevents love from turning into hatred or jealousy, and appreciation into low self-esteem. In life, if you do not adore or appreciate anything, you will be filled with negativity. And a person who has nothing to worship or adore is sure to fall into depression. </p>

<p>Lack of adoration has led to many emotional, psychological and social problems in the society. If you have nothing to hold up high in life, selfishness, arrogance and violence are sure to follow. Adoring and honoring each other in society eliminates stress and fosters compassion and love.</p>

<p>In the previous century, it was thought that worshipping was an uncivilized and unintelligent thing to do. Worship was thought to rise from a slavish mentality. In fact it is just the contrary. Worship can only happen through gratefulness and not through slavish mentality.</p>

<p>In worship, a sense of belongingness, love, honor and respect all come together. Without a sense of belongingness, worship or idealism can bring low self-esteem. The ancient people knew this so they insisted that people should feel part of what they worship. They encouraged people to worship the sun, moon, mountains, rivers, plants, animals and people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WORSHIP IN A TRUE SENSE IS A SIGN OF MATURITY AND NOT WEAKNESS.</p>

<p>Question: You said worship is the culmination of love. Does worship also have a culmination?</p>

<p>Answer: Culmination of worship is Self knowledge, Samadhi.</p> 		</font>

</font><font face="Arial" size="3"><p>Once every 12 years, all the seers, saints and aspirants of spiritual knowledge congregate at the confluence (sangam), of the 3 holy rivers, Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati. The Ganga is a symbol of Knowledge and Self-inquiry. It is on the banks of the Yamuna that events of love have been immortalized. When Knowledge and Love come together, when the head meets the heart, Saraswati, symbolic of wisdom and the fine arts emerge.</p>

<p>When a tiny atom explodes, the radiation lasts for a long time ... the mind is even more subtle than one millionth of an atom. When the mind explodes, that is Enlightenment.</p>

<p>Over the centuries, thousands of sages who have meditated, done penance and been enlightened come to the "Kumbha Mela" and relieve themselves of the burden of the merits gained through Sadhana by bathing in the rivers. Water has the quality to absorb the energy that they radiate. The seekers, who come from all corners to be in the company of the seers and saints, gain that merit when they take a dip in the rivers.</p>

<p>Space by itself cannot be bought, and a lump of clay has no value, but when space is enveloped by clay it gains value, this is a Kumbha (pot). Spirit is all over in Nature, but when it dawns in the human body as an elevated state of consciousness, then it gains immense value. An Embodied and elevated spirit is usually referred to as Kumbha. This is why the enlightened age is also called the Aquarian age. Kumbha denotes a pot, which is symbolic of fullness and perfection.</p>

</b><p><b>NEWS FLASH </b>Guruji was in Prayag for the Kumbha Mela. There were many very touching incidents that happened which show the depth of the devotion of the people who had gathered there. Here are two of them. </p>

<p>One morning, Guruji noticed an 80-year-old woman who had been separated from her folks. She looked tired and hungry. Guruji sent someone to give her some money, which she refused to accept saying that she had come here to give, not to take! Guruji Himself had to go to her and tell her that the money was prasad, which she then took from Him. </p>

<p>It was very cold there every night, the temperature dropping to 2 or 3 deg Celsius, and a lot of people had no accommodation whatsoever and would just sleep in the sand on the banks of the rivers, most of them not even having a shawl to cover themselves with. Guruji along with some yuvacharyas and other devotees would go and distribute a lot of blankets every night to these people. Thousands of blankets were distributed every night One night, they came across a teenager who was shivering with cold and gave him some blankets to cover himself with, which he refused to take saying, that he could bear this cold, and that there were so many others who would need them much more than him. </p>

<p>Guruji later told everyone to note the devotion and the total surrender of these people who even in such desperate circumstances had such absolute faith in the Divine and knew that He would provide for them.</p>

<p>Our Ashram was bustling with activity all day long and attracted many people; food was being served continuously, throughout the day. The community of saints there was overjoyed to meet with Guruji and lauded the work of Art of Living. </p>

<p>Back in Delhi Guruji had very fruitful meetings with various leaders including the leader of Jamma Masjid.</p>

<p>Secretaries, police, judges, accountants and people in key positions should not be friendly!</p>

<p>The main disadvantages of being friendly are:</p>
<p>1. You come under obligation</p>
<p>2. You lose your freedom</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;You can't have a free and fair perception. Your thoughts and actions may not be impartial</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Your focus, commitment, creativity and above all your time&nbsp;will be wasted</p>
<p>5&nbsp; You will pick up bad habits and negative moods easily</p>

<p>It takes a lot of wisdom to be free from the burden of obligation and not be influenced by your friends' opinions and feelings.</p>

<p>In many occasions, it is better to be unfriendly than be friendly. Being unfriendly does not mean being aggressive and inimical. The best secretaries,&nbsp;personal&nbsp;assistants, security personnel, and judges have to be unfriendly.</p>

<p>Those who are aloof and indifferent get centered more quickly than those who are too friendly. A certain degree of aloofness in every relationship will strengthen your personality and connect you to your source.</p>

<p>Vinod Sethi: It's very easy to be very aloof or very friendly. But to be friendly and aloof is a Sadhana.</p>

<p>From time to time the earth shakes and in its shaking wakes up the man who is in slumber, who not only misuses Nature but puts his faith in bricks and mortar. Your true security is in the Self<b> </b>not in bricks and mortar. Perhaps this is what Nature wants to convey to you. Earthquakes, floods and volcanoes all drive home the truth that nothing is permanent and you cannot find security in that which is not permanent. They all come to you as a shock and <b>wake you up<i>.</i></b></p><b><i>

</i></b><p>When such calamities occur we try to understand their cause so that we can blame someone. Strangely, when you find someone to blame you feel comfortable, but with natural calamities you cannot blame anyone. It comes to you as a shock. With wisdom, shocks can make you grow in leaps and bounds. Without wisdom a shock can only lead you to negativity and depression.</p>

<p>Q. Why should nature destroy small innocent children?</p>

<p>A. Nature just does its job. It does not discriminate between young and old. Do you think that all those who eat bamboo shoots and eggs or pluck flower buds are not compassionate�&nbsp;maybe, maybe not! (laughterũ</p>

<p>Instead of questioning Nature, wake up and see the opportunity for seva (service). See whatҳ happening in Gujarat now. Today, hundreds and thousands are engaged in service activities that would not have happened otherwise. One positive thing coming out of destruction is the reconstruction of Gujarat which would not have happened if not for earthquake. Another interesting factor is a fresh water spring that has appeared in a region that has been continuously drought prone.</p>

<p>Wisdom is to consider the earth as your Valentine. Whether it shakes or breaks, it is dear to you. You always see good coming from it.</p>

<p>The four elements, other than space, create turbulence from time to time. If you depend on them for support, they will shake you and lead you back to space.</p>

Medical experts, after diagnosis and treatment, declared no possibility of regaining her hearing. After attending the first day of the residential basic course at the Ashram on 19<sup>th</sup> Jan 2001, she miraculously regained her hearing. Where medical science had failed, her Guru's grace transformed her life.</p>

<p>Research at the All India Institute of Medical Science showed significant changes in the brain wave patterns of the AOL teachers who participated in the study. All 18 subjects were found to maintain high integrity and awareness during activity.</p>

<p>That which brings together these two completely different aspects in you, is your spirit. The same spirit that wants to be self-reliant is also passionate.  It is only in spirituality that passion and dispassion can happen together.  This is the rarest combination.</p>

<p>When you are dispassionate, you have strength, and strength is self-reliance.  True self-reliance is realizing that nothing is excluded from the Self.  And when you realize everything is part of the Self, then you can be passionate about everything!  Even to fulfill your passion, you can only rely on the Self, for Self alone is non-changing.</p>

<p>In Truth, there is neither reliance nor passion.  In one state, you can either be passionate or you can be self-reliant. But in an elevated state of consciousness, you can be neither, or both!</p> 		</font>

<p>Shivratri - From every corner of India, and from all over the world, devotees came for Shiva's blessings! </p>

<p>Despite the Ashram overflowing with thousands, there was absolutely no chaos as the volunteers of the YTP (Youth Training Program) did wonderful seva and won everyone's hearts. It was celebration all round; even the ice-creams sold like hot cakes.  During the morning Rudra-puja, even the windows of the meditation hall were filled to capacity. Huge screens were layed out in the amphitheatre for the evening Puja, which was followed by a spellbinding satsang with Guruji truly Bholenath �&nbsp;Lord of the Innocent! The celebrations continued until early morning as devotees queued for darshan.</p>

<p align="CENTER">The Usefulness of Fear</p>

<p>Nature has put an amount of inbuilt fear in all living beings. This fear makes life defend itself, protect itself. Like salt in the food, a little bit of fear is essential for people to be righteous.</p>

<p>Fear of hurting someone makes you more conscious.</p>
<p>Fear of failure makes you more keen and dynamic.</p>
<p>Fear moves you from carelessness to taking care.</p>
<p>Fear moves you from being insensitive to being sensitive.</p>
<p>Fear moves you from dullness to alertness.</p>

<p>Total lack of fear may lead to destructive tendencies - a distorted ego knows no fear. Neither does the expanded consciousness! Whereas the ego dismisses the fear and moves in a disruptive manner, the wise one acknowledges the fear and takes refuge in the Divine.</p>

<p>When you are in love, when you are surrendered, there is no fear. Ego, too, knows no fear. But there is a difference, like that of heaven and earth, between these two types of fearless states.</p>

<p>Fear makes you righteous; fear brings you close to surrender; fear keeps you on the path; keeps you from being destructive. Peace and law are maintained on the planet because of fear.</p>

<p>A new-born child knows no fear - it totally relies on its mother. Whether a child, a kitten or a bird, when they start becoming independent they experience fear which makes them go running back to their mothers.&nbsp; This is inbuilt by nature to sustain life.</p>

<p>So, the purpose of fear is to bring you back to the source!!</p> 		</font>

</b><p><b>NEWS FLASH</b> Guruj's entire journey from Bombay to Surat was punctuated by Darshan. Enthusiastic devotees, in hundreds, thronged every station. 40,000 attended the live Kriya in Surat setting off a wave of energy, culminating in a high-vol&nbsp;satsang of over 300,000 people.</p>

<p>On to Ahmedabad, where Guruji's meeting with the Chief Minister and bureaucrats proved extremely useful. Guruji suggested drastic changes in the lay-out plan of the 900 quake-hit villages which are to be rebuilt. His ideas were greatly appreciated and immediately incorporated.</p>

<p>Guruji wondered whether He was awakening people or not, but devotees who showed up all night at different stations between Ahmedabad and Udaipur, armed with musical bands, definitely kept waking everyone up with their fervor!</p>

<p>Guruji's first ever visit to the City of Jheels (lakes), Udaipur, saw a grand satsang. He also met with NGO's and gave a highly illuminating talk on Integrated Social Development. Gliding softly over the moon-lit waters in a boat to the glittering Jagmandir, He was given a royal reception and the satsang happened in regal splendour!</p>

<p>"When the Divine dwells in your heart, the whole world appears to you as a temple�quot;</p>

<p>Guruji's entourage decided that it was high time He stopped traveling by train. On the last leg of this wonderfully eventful trip from Udaipur to Delhi, there was a brief stop-over for 20 minutes at Jaipur where a welcome stage and over a thousand devotees compelled Guruji to deplane and give Darshan right there, even at the airport, where Satsang happened spontaneously!!!</p>

  	    <b><p align="CENTER">THE PARADOX OF SACRIFICE</p>
</b>
<p>All the scriptures of the world glorify sacrifice. What is sacrifice?</p>

<p>It is giving up something that you value. You can only sacrifice that which you would like to keep for yourself; in other words, that which gives you pleasure and joy. You cannot sacrifice something that you dislike or disown. Sacrifice is always related to a higher cause for a greater good. At the same time, when your love for the greater good is so strong, nothing else assumes any value. Sacrifice here becomes irrelevant, because love alone is your strongest driving force. So when there is so much love there cannot be sacrifice. At the same time when there is no love, there is no sacrifice.</p>

<p>For example, if a mother has made plans to see a movie and she realizes that her child is sick, she does not say that she has sacrificed the movie to nurse her child, because she simply did not want to go. Nothing else seems to charm the mother besides being with her child.</p>

<p>You do not sacrifice something for someone you are in love with. Sacrifice indicates that your pleasure has more value than the cause for which you are sacrificing. When the love is lukewarm, then sacrifice assumes meaning. Yet sacrifice purifies the human mind and reins in selfish tendencies. It can also bring pride, arrogance, self-pity and sometimes even depression. </p>

<p>You can sacrifice only that which you value. For a wise man nothing is more valuable than truth, values and the Divine, and he will never sacrifice those. God is the greatest, and if he values the greatest then how can he sacrifice God? This is the paradox of sacrifice.</p> 		</font>

</font><font face="Arial"><p>Divinity is unmanifest, but man has an innate desire to perceive the divine in the manifest creation around him. He creates idols, breathes faith into it and requests divinity to be present in that idol for a while, so that he can worship, express his love and play with it. At the end of his worship he requests divinity to go back into his heart from where divinity manifested. This is in all puja practices. </p>

<p>They are not actually worshipping the idols but worshipping the unmanifest divinity which has all the divine qualities. So, the idol worshippers of the East are not the same as the ones in the Middle East as described in the Bible, because they are not just worshipping different gods and different idols, they are worshipping the ONE divinity in many different forms. </p>

<p>Paganism, Satan and animal worship, without the knowledge of the one divinity is very different from seeing the divine in every form of the manifest universe. In the eastern tradition, gods and goddesses are part of the one divinity like the different colors of white sunlight, whereas in the Greek tradition, gods and goddesses are in themselves different entities. </p>

<p>Worshipping Satan and different entities is totally different from worshipping divinity in its various forms. Every form belongs to the divine. When you adore the form, you are adoring the divine behind the form. </p>

<p>With this knowledge, the very act of worship, which is more an inner phenomenon, assumes a more colorful and vibrant expression, indicating that both the form and the formless are all divine. </p> 		</font>

<p>5H WALK REPORT: <font face="Arial" size="3">25,000 people in 30 cities on 5 continents participated in the first Walk for 5H on Sunday, March 11, 2001, which evolved into the 5H Walk for Gujarat after the recent earthquake in India.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="3">

<p>The initial seed was planted by Bawa as he toured the US teaching DSN courses last fall, where course participants took responsibility for organizing a 5H walk in their local area as a follow-up seva project.  One thing led to another, and soon, cities all around the world had signed up to participate in this unique global 5H event, where all the participating cities walked to raise awareness and funds for 5H projects already taking place in the earthquake-affected areas of Gujarat.</p>

<p>Walk coordinators quickly realized that organizing a walk was no small feat - it required a committed team of volunteers to carefully plan and execute the many details involved.  Some had to overcome many obstacles in pulling a team together.  But after the event everyone had experienced such overwhelming personal growth.  Amit from Boston said, "I had always thought that a lot of my buttons were dead.  I worked through the last one month with so many of my buttons getting pushed, with tons and tons of grumbling and complaining. Even with so much awareness I could not change the state of my mind.  But just as the walk ended on Sunday, something flipped and I felt centered again. This was sooo amazing!"</p>

<p>The overwhelming grace of the Guru was the invisible hand that guided all those involved. Madhu from Washington DC said, "Just 3 days before the event we had no media coming but we decided to call the major press and news channels anyway.  Early on Sunday morning, NBC, CBS and FOX were all eagerly awaiting to televise the event even before the volunteers had turned up, and The Washington Post (the major local newspaper) came to cover the event.  I just can't understand how this happened - this is simply unheard of!"  Senator Hillary Clinton also sent a personal letter strongly supporting the walk.  She said, "I am grateful for your dedication to this important cause.  It is my hope that your efforts will inspire others to take part in actions large and small, public and private, to uplift individuals, families, communities and nations throughout our global society."</p>

<p>The skillful combination of buzzing daily satsangs balanced with die-hard seva warriors scouring the streets late into the night ensured that everyone in Dallas knew about 5H and the walk.  "20,000 people know about the walk here.  There is not one street corner we've left unturned.  The energy here is unbelievable," said James Paul.</p>

<p>The walk was a perfect symbol of harmony in diversity, pulling together diverse groups of people from several communities.  Jeffrey from Jakarta said, "300 Jakarta citizens, some coming by chartered buses as far as 1.5 hours away, came to walk for 5H.  Participants came from diverse nationalities and religious beliefs.  A catholic organization, St. Karnaius, even provided an ambulance to cover the walk."</p>

<p>The Maha 5H walk took place in Mumbai.  Here the walk started from 5 different points of a circle, each group converging at the center of the circle, the landmark Shivaji Park.  The first group to arrive at the park was met within minutes by all the other groups who also converged at the park like clockwork.  The post-event celebrations started with a street play symbolizing the 5H's and culminated into a rocking satsang of 5,000.  Dinesh noted, "There was definitely a Harmony in Diversity.  Not only Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, the Maharashtrians, the Gujaratis and the South Indians but also the young and the old, the rich and the poor walked shoulder to shoulder and sang heart to heart."</p>

<p>And finally, once it was all over, Ashish from Dallas exclaimed, "Hey guys, it's not over!  This was just the first step."</p></font>

</font></b><p><font face="Arial">Many people do not want to work under someone else, be it in their profession, in any company or even voluntary service. The general notion is that when you work under someone, you lose your freedom, you have to be answerable.</font></p><font face="Arial">

<p>So, many people opt for business, wanting to be their own boss. But, in business, you are accountable to so many people. If you cannot be accountable to even one person, how can you be accountable to many? This is the paradox. In fact, being in business binds you more than the boss!</p>

<p>Refusing to work under someone is a sign of weakness, not strength. A strong person would not feel uncomfortable working under anyone, because he knows his strength. It is the weak and poor in spirit who do not like to work under someone else, because they are unaware of their&nbsp;strength. They can be neither successful in business nor in any profession.</p>

<p>And the same is true even in the field&nbsp;of social service - often volunteers do not want to work under someone else. This is merely an exhibition of their weakness. With such an attitude, they achieve very little.</p>

<p>One who is timid and weak in spirit would be uncomfortable to work even under the Wise one; but one who knows his own strength can work effectively even under a fool!</p>

<p>Nityanand: But to work under a fool is frustrating!</p>
<p>SriSri: When you know your strength, with skill and intelligence, you can turn every disadvantage into an advantage. A fool can bring out the best of your communication skills! (laughter)</p>

<p>So watch out! If you feel uncomfortable working under someone, it clearly shows you need to strengthen yourself. Desiring freedom from circumstances, situations or people is no freedom at all. Knowing that nobody can take away your freedom �&nbsp;that is strength! And when you realize your strength is unshakable, you would not mind working under anybody.</p>

</b>
<p>A commitment can only be felt when it oversteps convenience. That which is convenient, you do not call commitment. If you just go on your convenience, your commitment falls apart causing more inconvenience! If you keep dropping your commitment because it is inconvenient, can you be comfortable? Often, what is convenient does not bring comfort, but gives an illusion of comfort. Also if you are too stuck in commitment, and it is too inconvenient too often, you will be unable to fulfill your commitment and it will only generate frustration. Wisdom is to strike a balance between convenience and commitment because both bring comfort to the body, mind and spirit. </p>

<p>A seeker of knowledge should forget about convenience, so should soldiers, rulers, students, seekers of wealth and all essential service providers. Those who want to be creative and adventurous transcend convenience. Those who are ambitious and have a passion for a goal do not care for convenience. To the wise their commitment is their comfort. Whenever their commitment is shaken, their comfort is also shaken. To the lazy, commitment is torture though it is the best remedy. </p>

<p>Commitment will always bring comfort in the long run. </p>

<p>Question: Are there any commitments that can be given up? </p>

<p>Answer: Yes. </p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes when you are committed without a vision, you feel stifled when your vision expands. Such commitments made with shortsightedness can be given up.</li>
<li>A smaller less important commitment can be given up for a greater commitment.</li>
<li>Commitment to the means can be given up for the sake of the commitment to the goals.</li>
<li>When your commitment brings misery to many in the long run it can be given up. </li></ul> 		</font>

<p>Guruji held up a pistachio nut and asked every one. "What is this?" Everybody said, "Pistachio." Guruji held up a pistachio nut without the shell and asked every one, "What is this?" Everybody said, "Pistachio." Guruji then held up the shell and asked everyone, "What is this?" Every body said, "Shell." </p>

<p>Guruji said, "As the nut with or without the shell is pistachio, similarly spirit with or without the body is God. But just as the shell without the nut is not pistachio, the body without spirit is not God. Spirit is certainly God because it is present everywhere. The body is certainly not God because it cannot be present everywhere." </p>

<p>When someone asks you, "Are you God?" Who is the question addressed to? As it is only the spirit that answers, you have no choice but to say, "Yes!" There was a blissful glee on everyoneҳ faces. </p>

<p>God is within the body and God embodies the whole universe. Those who have eyes will see. (When asked, "Are you God?"- This is the best answer.) </p>

</b><p><b><br>
</b>When someone blames you, you feel a heavy load on your head, and when you talk about it you spread the unpleasant feeling all around you. At this moment wake up and see you are Being and nothing can touch you. This is all just a drama, which you yourself have created. You have gone through this over and over again. All the blames you face in your life are your own creation. Knowing this, you feel free and light.<br>
<br>
Owning responsibility for all your experiences in life makes you powerful and will put an end to grumbling, planning counter attacks, explanations, and all those host of negative tendencies. Owning full responsibility you become free. <br>
<br>
When someone blames you, directly or indirectly, what do you do?<br>
<br>
Do you register it in your mind and get emotionally upset?<br>
Do you dismiss them altogether without taking a lesson from it?<br>
Do you talk about it with people and waste your time and otherҳ time and money?<br>
Do you pity yourself and blame your shortcomings?<br>
Do you blame the other person right, left and center?<br>
Do you generalize and eternalize the problem? <br>
<br>
Then you are not living up to the knowledge. You need to do the basic course at least half a dozen times and read all the previous knowledge sheets.<br>
<br>
Do you laugh at it and not even take notice of it?<br>
Do you treat it as a non-event, not even worth talking about, let alone taking any action? <br>
Do you treat comments and accusations as passing clouds and more of an entertainment?<br>
Do you discourage dwelling on unpleasant and negative moments?<br>
Do you remain non-judgmental and absolutely unshaken in your space of love? <br>
Outwardly you may be calm, but do you also remain centered and calm within you and not even take pride in your growth or wisdom? <br>
<br>
Then you are a pride to your tutor - the Master.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
You cannot take credit for loving Guruji or any wise person, as you have no choice at all as it will happen against all odds!<br>
<br>
To love someone whom you like is not a big deal at all. <br>
To love someone because they love you, you get zero marks.<br>
To love someone whom you do not like, you have learned a lesson in life. <br>
To love someone who blames you for no reason, you have learned the art of living.</p> 		</font>

</b><p><b><br>
</b>Ambition indicates lack of self-confidence!</p>

<p>When you know you can achieve something easily, you are not ambitious about it.  You are simply confident about it. Your ambition indicates challenge and uncertainty, which is contrary to self-confidence. So one you has total self-confidence cannot be ambitious!!</p>

<p>At the same time a person who lacks total self-confidence cannot be ambitious either!!</p>

<p>For ambition to be, one must have a little bit of confidence and total ignorance of the Self. </p>

<p>It is next to impossible to have total confidence without  Self-knowledge. </p>

<p>With the knowledge of the Self, there is nothing left to achieve, for the entire nature of existence is mere</p>
<p>play and display of one's own consciousness. </p>

<p>People take pride in being ambitious. The wise man will only smile at them.  Ambition can never be for</p>
<p>something you know you can achieve effortlessly. You can only be ambitious about something for which you have to put effort, which poses a challenge and of which you are not even certain you will be able to achieve or not. </p>

<p>Moreover it takes away the joy of the moment.</p>

<p>With the Self-knowledge nothing is challenging to you, nor you need to put any effort. Nature is ready to</p>
<p>fulfill your intention even before they arise, giving you no chance to crave or desire. Nature does not</p>
<p>allow the wise to have a desire (ambition), and the unwise to fulfill or get rid of the desire (ambition).</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Do you still want to be ambitious ?? Or is your only ambition is to get rid of ambition !!</p>

</b></font><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">Belongingness can bring about a host of negative emotions. Like demand, jealousy, unawareness and lack of gratitude. Just look into your own life, you feel more grateful to strangers than the people you feel "belong" to you. Belongingness reduces gratefulness, awareness, and gives rise to demands which destroys love. This is the biggest problem in relationships. People are nice to strangers and give more attention to them. With a sense of belongingness comes carefreeness and lack of attention.</font><font size="3"><br>
</font></p><font size="3">
</font><font face="Arial" size="3"><p>Look&nbsp;belongingness can make you insensitive, dull, and take away the charm in life!</p>
<p>Anyway, who belongs to whom in this world? Here you are a stranger and everyone is a stranger to you!</p>
<p>Blessed are those who feel themselves as a stranger!</p>
<p>You feel more obligation to a stranger than the person you feel belongs to you. Obligation is very good to keep a check on your ego. It makes you humble. There is no greater antidote to ego than humility. Being humble is the beginning of all virtues.</p>
<p>People have such resistance for obligations. They do not realize that they are always under obligations, whether giving or taking! Dull people think that one is obliged only when one takes. The wise knows that even when one is giving one is under obligations, as the person has accepted what one gives. So whether you give or take you are under obligations. And if someone does not give or take, you are still under obligation! For they are freeing you from visible obligations!!</p>
<p>That is to say, you are obliged to all those who do not make you obliged!!! A&nbsp;Got it? </p>
<p>Life (you) renews itself everytime by becoming a stranger in this old and familiar world.</p>

<br>
Often when you are happy you feel life is a dream because you do not believe in the reality of it.&nbsp; When there is misery you feel life as a burden.&nbsp; And we take trivial things very seriously.&nbsp; But one who has really gone through the pleasure realizes that pleasure is a burden.&nbsp; And if you have undergone misery thoroughly you will realize that life is a dream.&nbsp; In every miserable condition you have been walked or carried through and you realize life is a dream.&nbsp; When you see life is dream a burden or a joke only then can you be centered.<br>
<br>
And when you have really gone through misery you have really seen life as a dream.&nbsp; And in between the pain and pleasure life is all a joke.<br>
<br>
Life is very uncertain.&nbsp; Before it takes you away, realize it is a dream, a burden or a joke.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Someone asked:&nbsp; What about life is a joke?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Answer:&nbsp; A joke you do not question.&nbsp; If you question a joke, it is no longer a joke.&nbsp; Do not question a burden either.&nbsp; It is a waste of time to question life and its events.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The burden makes you go deep.&nbsp; It gets you to the core of yourself.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Realization of a dream wakes you up.&nbsp; And seeing life as a joke makes you light. <br>
<br>
The only certainty is that life is a dream, a burden or a joke and only when you realize this can you be centered.</p> 		</font>

Reason is repetition. Faith is exploration.<br>
Reason is routine. Faith is adventure.</p>
<p>They are completely opposite, yet an integral part of life.</p>

<p>Not having faith itself is misery; faith gives instant comfort. While reasoning keeps you sane and grounded, no miracle can happen without faith. Faith takes you beyond limitations. In faith you can transcend the laws of nature but it needs to be pure. Faith is beyond reason, yet you need to have faith in your own reasoning! (A sentence to be pondered on.) Faith and reason cannot exist without each other. Every reason is based on some faith. Whenever reason or faith breaks, confusion and chaos prevails which is often a step for growth.</p>

<p>There are two types of faith. Faith out of fear, greed and insecurity; and faith born out of love like the faith between the mother and the child, the Master and disciple.  Whereas the faith out of love cannot be broken, faith out of fear and greed is shaky.</p>

<p>An atheist bases himself on reason, and a believer on faith. A believer uses God as an insurance policy! He thinks he is special. In the eyes of God there is no "mine" and "others"; all are the same. An atheist rationalizes to keep his eyes shut to reality. Death shakes them both! When someone close dies, an atheist eyes are opened, and a believerҳ faith cracks. Only a Yogi - a wise one - remains unshaken. For that person has transcended both reason and faith.</p>

</font></b><p><font face="Arial">What is that you can do for eternity? Definitely not anything that is big or great because it needs effort and effort tires you. So, it is a temporary state. If you can think of one thing that is way below your capacity to do and agree to do it for eternity, that becomes Pooja.<br>
<br>
The readiness to consciously do trivial things for eternity unites you with eternity. This is an antidote to ego. Ego is always ambitious and wants to do the toughest job like climbing Mount Everest etc. Whereas in a simple act like watching a butterfly, watering the garden, watching the birds or the sky, can bring deep relaxation, and relaxation connects you with your source. Not that you do trivial things all your life, but consciously agreeing to do the trivial actions for eternity, opens a new dimension and brings in immense peace and restfulness.<br>
<br>
To find rest in activity, choose an activity that is far below your capacity and agree to do it until eternity. Doing a job far below your capacity and being satisfied with it will make it possible to do a job much beyond your capacity.<br>
<br>
Know that all actions are born out of infinity and that which is born out of infinity can take you to infinity. </font></p><font face="Arial"> 		</font>

<p>If you are saddened by other�s sorrow then sorrow will never come to you.</p>

<p>Deep rest is bliss, and bliss is the understanding that only God exists. Knowing that only God exists is the deepest rest possible.</p>

<p>This conviction or experience that "only God exists" is Samadhi. Samadhi is the mother of all talents, strengths and virtues. Samadhi is needed even for the most materialistic person because a materialistic person looks to gain strength and virtues. To be in Samadhi you do not need any effort or talents, strengths or virtues.</p>

<p>Withdrawing from all types of physical and mental activity is rest. That is in-built in our system as sleep, and sleep is the best friend of activity. Samadhi is a conscious rest. Samadhi is the best friend of life. To be alive in your full potential, Samadhi is indispensable. </p>

  	    <b><font face="Arial"><p align="CENTER">Five Types of Restlessness</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial">
<p>There are five types of restlessness.</p>

<p>The first type of restlessness is due to the place you are in. When you move away from that place, the street or the house, you immediately feel better. Chanting, singing, children playing and laughing can change this atmospheric restlessness. If you chant and sing, the vibration in the place changes.</p>

<p>The second type of restlessness is in the body. Eating the wrong food or vata aggravating food, eating at odd times, not exercising, and overworking can all cause a physical restlessness. The remedy for this is exercise, moderation in work habits and going on a vegetable or juice diet for one or two days.</p>

<p>The third type of restlessness is mental restlessness. It is caused by ambition, strong thoughts, likes or dislikes. Knowledge alone can cure this restlessness. Seeing life from a broader perspective, knowledge about the Self and the impermanence of everything. If you achieve everything, so what? After your achievement, you will die. Knowledge of your death or life, confidence in the Self, in the Divine, can all calm down the mental restlessness.</p>

<p>Then there is emotional restlessness. Any amount of knowledge does not help here. Only Kriya helps! All that emotional restlessness vanishes. Also the presence of the Guru, a wise person, or a saint will help to calm your emotional restlessness.</p>

<p>The fifth type of restlessness is rare. It is the restlessness of the soul. When everything feels empty and meaningless, know you are very fortunate. That longing and restlessness is the restlessness of the soul. Do not try to get rid of it. Embrace it! Welcome it! Usually to get rid of it people do all sorts of things - they change places, jobs or partners, do this, do that. It seems to help for some time, but it does not last.</p>

<p>This restlessness of the soul alone can bring authentic prayer in you. It brings perfection, Siddhis and miracles in life. It is so precious to get that inner most longing for the Divine.  Satsang, the presence of the enlightened one, soothes the restlessness of the soul.</p> 		</font>

<b><p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
</b><p>Life moves by dual (two) factors: inner tendencies and outer influences.</p>

<p>Inner tendencies form your attitudes and behavior, while external influences makes strong impressions in your mind. Often your tendencies generate external situations. And situations around you can form tendencies within you. This is what is called Karma. Both these factors -  the tendencies from within and influences from outside, can either be beneficial or harmful.</p>

<p>It is the awareness that filters the outer negative influences and it is the awareness that corrects and annihilates the unhealthy inner tendencies. This awareness is called Gyana. The purpose of education is to develop this awareness, so that you can be selective about your tendencies and influences.</p>

<p>It is practically impossible to resist the external influences and the inner tendencies without raising one�s consciousness. This can be gradual or sudden. And that is how a human being has both free will and destiny.</p>

<p>Freedom is when you have a say about your tendencies and your influences. And only awareness and impeccable devotion can bring this freedom.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Authenticity and skillfulness appear to be contradictory, but in fact they are complementary. Your intentions need to be authentic and your actions need to be skillful. The more authentic the intention, the more skillful the action will be. Authentic intention and skillful action make you unshakable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Skill is required only when authenticity cannot have its way. Yet skill without authenticity makes you shallow. You cannot have an authentic action and a skillful intention. If you try to be authentic in your action but manipulative in your mind, that is when mistakes happen.</p> <p>&nbsp;John: Is it possible to have a powerful intention, like greed, that is authentic?</p> <p>Sri Sri: If your intention is colored by greed, over-ambition, etc. then your intention is not authentic. Whenever your intentions are impure, it pricks your consciousness, so it cannot be authentic. Authentic intentions are free from negative emotions. An action that is not skillful leads to negative emotions and an intention that is not authentic harbors negative emotions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Gayatri: If our intention is authentic and yet our actions are not skillful, what should we do?</p>
<p>Sri Sri: Carry a handkerchief (<i>laughter</i>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Question: What is the best skill to deal with intention?</p>
<p>Sri Sri: Do not keep any sankalpas (intentions) to yourself. Offer them to the Divine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Actions can never be perfect but our intentions can be perfect. Actions always have room for improvement. Action means growth and movement, and that needs space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The depth in you and the freedom in you bring out all the skillfulness in you. Krishna was the most skillful because his silence was so deep. </p> 		</font>

<p>Become God to each other. Do not look for God somewhere in the sky, but see God in every pair of eyes, in the mountains, water, trees and animals. How? Only when you see God in yourself. Only Gods can worship Gods. To recognize divinity, there are three dimensions: time, space and mind.</p>
<p>For a seeker, it is necessary to honor time and space so he or she can experience sacredness in his or her mind. When you honor time and space, your mind becomes alert.

<p>Precious moments are few in life. Catch them and treasure them. Place, time, mood of mind are factors that influence celebration. Snatch every opportunity to celebrate, then you feel great and full. Then celebration infiltrates your mind in all moods and space, and celebration is inevitable. Celebration reminds you of the fullness of the moment. The moments you are in the company of knowledge - the Master - are the most precious moments in your life. Treasure them.

</font></b><font face="Arial">
<p>Mistakes keep happening all the time. Often you get irritated by them and want to correct them. How much can you correct?&nbsp; There are two situations when you correct other�s mistakes:</p>

<p>1. You correct someone�s mistake because it bothers you. But even if you correct it, this does not work.</p>
<p>2. You correct someone�s mistake, not because it bothers you, but for their sake so that they can grow.</p>

<p>To correct mistakes you need authority and love. Authority and love seem to be contradictory, but in reality they are not. Authority without love is stifling and does not work. Love without authority is shallow. A friend needs to have both authority and love but they need to be in the right combination. This can happen if you are totally dispassionate and centered.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When you allow room for mistakes, you can be both authoritative and sweet. That is how the Divine is, the right balance of both. Krishna and Jesus had both. People, when they are in love, exercise authority with each other. Authority and love exist in all relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a pleasure in rest and there is a pleasure in activity. The pleasure in activity is momentary and causes fatigue. The pleasure in rest is magnanimous and energizing. So, to the one who has tasted pleasure in rest (Samadhi), the pleasure in activity is insignificant. All activities that you do, you do so that you can have deep rest. Activity is part of the system. However, the real pleasure is in Samadhi. In order to have deep rest, one must be active. The proper balance of both is essential. Many seek pleasure in this or that but the wise man just smiles.

</b>
<p>The head worries and the heart feels.&nbsp; They cannot function at the same time.</p>

<p>When your feelings dominate, worry dissolves.</p>

<p>If you worry a lot, your feelings are dead; you are stuck in the head. Worrying makes your mind and heart inert and dull. Worries are like a rock in the head. Worry entangles you.&nbsp; Worry puts you in a cage.</p>

<p>When you feel, you do not worry.</p>

<p>Feelings are like flowers, they come up, they blossom and they die. Feelings rise, they fall and then disappear. When feelings are expressed, you feel relieved. When you are angry, you express your anger and the next moment you are all right.&nbsp; Or you are upset, you cry and you get over it.</p>

<p>Feelings last for some short time and then they drop, but worry eats at you for a longer period of time, and eventually eats you up.</p>

<p>Feelings make you spontaneous.&nbsp; Children feel, so they are spontaneous. Adults put brakes on their feelings and they start worrying.&nbsp; Worrying about anything obstructs action while feelings propel action.&nbsp; Worrying about negative feelings is a blessing because it puts the brakes on those feelings, preventing you from acting on them.&nbsp; Usually one never worries about positive feelings.&nbsp; Worries are uncertain.&nbsp; Worrying takes away your energy; you cannot think clearly when you worry.</p>

<p>Offering your worries is prayer and prayer moves you in feelings.</p>

<p>When you think you are feeling too much then you start worrying about your feelings.&nbsp; Let�s not worry about it and feel our food!</p> 		</font>

<p>God created man and the whole world with so many varieties, so many good things. God made so many types of vegetables, fragrances, flowers and thorns, dragons and horror, to please man and keep him entertained. But man got more and more depressed. </p>

<p>God then acted tough and man had to start pleasing Him. And so, man kept himself busy pleasing God and he became happier since he had no time to get worried or depressed. </p>

<p>In the Orient, having a master is considered a matter of pride. A master is a symbol of security, love and a sign of great wealth. Being with the guru is like being with one�s higher self. Not having a master was looked down upon as being an orphan, being poor and a sign of misfortune. The word "anatha" in Sanskrit, means one without a master. Those without a master were considered to be orphans, but not those without parents.</p>

<p>But in the Occident, having a master is considered a matter of shame and a sign of weakness, for masters are known for enslaving people.</p>

<p>In the Orient people take pride in having a guru and there is a guru for every discipline � a religious guru (dharma), a family guru (kula), a rajguru (guru for the kingdom), a vidyaguru (guru for a particular discipline) and a satguru (spiritual guru).</p>

<p>In the Orient, masters made you feel powerful; in the Occident, masters made you weak.</p>

<p>In the Orient, there was a deep sense of belongingness that would enable one to dissolve the limited identity into infinity. But in the Occident, a master was a motivator and one who provoked competition.</p> 		</font>

</font></b><font face="Arial">

<p>Why are people hungry for power?</p>

<p>People are hungry for power because they want attention and recognition. </p>

<p>Power is a means, just like money. Passion is for an end. People who do not see power or money as a means, but see it as an end in itself, they do not live, they simply exist.</p>

<p>If you do not realize that you are THE power -- that is to say that you are enlightened, then you crave for power. </p>
<p>	</p>
<p>You crave for attention and recognition if:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>

<li>You don�t have any talents, </li>
<li>You have no love or passion, </li>
<li>You are not innocent and childlike.</li></ol>

<p> </p>
<p>If you don�t have any talent and you are not contributing anything substantial to society, like an artist or a scientist, or an Art of Living teacher or volunteer, then you are hungry for power.</p>

<p>If you don�t have love or passion to bring about transformation in the society, then you are hungry for power.</p>

<p>If you are not innocent and childlike and don�t have a sense of belongingness with the whole world, then you are hungry for power.</p>

<p>Those who do not have any of these four, like some politicians, crave for power.</p>

<p>The true power is the power of the spirit; real confidence, strength and happiness all spring from the spirit. And one who knows this and has this is not hungry for power at all. </p> 		</font>

</font></b><font face="Arial">
<p>Man has a tendency to own things. When he owns something small his mind stays small, his life gets stifled and his whole consciousness is immersed in his house, car, spouse, children and such. A recluse leaves his home and goes far away. There also he starts owning his asana, rosary, books, concepts and his knowledge. </p>

<p>The owning has simply shifted from objects and people to ideas and practices. But a wise one knows that he owns the sun, the moon, the stars, the air, all of space and the Divine in its entirety. When you own something big then your consciousness also expands, and when you own something small then all the small negative emotions start coming up such as anger, greed, etc. </p>

<p>I wonder why people do not feel connected to the sun? The very existence of life depends upon the sun. Perhaps it is the lack of awareness that one refuses to acknowledge and own one�s connectedness to the macro-cosmic universe. The Rishis in ancient India, the Native Americans and the aboriginals from all over the globe have insisted that you can feel connection to the sun, moon and the directions. </p>

<p>When you own something magnanimous your consciousness also becomes magnanimous. </p>

<p>Worst Act of Reason is War.</p>

<p>Every war has a reason, and the reason justifies the war. Those who engage in war, reason it out. But reason is limited. As reason changes, justification falls apart.</p>

<p>All the reasons for every war appear to be justifiable to some limited minds and for limited time. Hence, war becomes inevitable on this planet.</p>

<p>War is limited to human beings. No other species in creation engage in war or mass destruction, as they have no reason. Animals have their prey and let everything just be. But mankind, from time immemorial, has been engaging in war because Man lives on reason. Man gives reason to every act of his and justifies it. As reasons change, his justifications fall apart.</p>

<p>Man has to transcend reason, and only then can he realize the Divinity. Then he does not engage in war. Only when people become sensible, rise above hatred and have heightened consciousness can the war be stopped.</p> 		</font>

<p>In this week alone�</p>
<p>Guruji was the state guest of four different Indian states � Meghalaya, Assam, West Bengal and Tripura! Estimated crowds of over 250,000 people have taken darshan and blessings of Guruji! Estimated crowds of over 35,000 people have done Sudarshan Kriya with Guruji!</p>

<p>At Calcutta, Guruji addressed delegates of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce with His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The evening Satsang had 30,000 people rapt in meditation and blissfully singing bhajans. Memorable yagnyas were performed at Calcutta and Guwahati for harmony in the world.</p>

<p>Guwahati welcomed Guruji with beautiful Assamese Bihu songs and dance sequences. Guruji emphasized the need to protect the rich and diverse Assamese culture. Thousands braved the rains to be in the evening Satsang. Guruji inaugurated the Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Vidya Mandir (school) at Guwahati by ringing the bell. After a cruise on the river Brahmaputra, the entourage left for Siliguri for less than a 24-hour stay!</p>

<p>Siliguri, a town in the foothill of the Darjeeling, (close to Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim), celebrated His arrival with all roads leading to the Mega Satsang. Guruji�s entourage had no risk of getting lost, as any resident of the town could guide them to Guruji�s place of residence and Satsang! The Maha Kriya in the morning had thousands doing the Sudarshan Kriya with Guruji, while the Mega Satsang had over 50,000 people singing, dancing and celebrating the grace of Guruji. At Siliguri, Guruji graced the Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Vidya Mandir and inaugurated the Rural Training Centre in the Siliguri Ashram premises. The entourage is now headed to Agartala for the last leg of Guruji�s tour of the North East.</p>

  	    <b><font face="Arial"><p align="CENTER">TERRORISM: THE CAUSE AND THE REMEDY</p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p><font face="Arial">
<p>The act which is only destructive and inflicts suffering both on oneself and others is terrorism. In such an act, human values are lost in the process of achieving a goal.</p>

<p>Some of the factors that lead to terrorism are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frustration and desperation to achieve a goal</li>
<li>Confused emotion</li>
<li>Shortsightedness and Impulsive action</li>
<li>Belief in a non-verifiable concept of heaven and merit; a childish concept of God favoring some and angry at others, thereby undermining the omniscience and omnipotence of the Divine.</li></ul>


<p>Terrorism induces fear psychosis in all, increases poverty, suffering and loss of life with no apparent gains. Instead of solutions the terrorist looks for destruction as an answer. If you simply criticize without giving a solution, know that this criticism comes from the same seed as terrorism! </p>

<p>Although there are certain qualities you can appreciate in a terrorist such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fearlessness </li>
<li>Commitment to a goal</li>
<li>Sacrifice</li></ul>


<p>You will have to learn from them things that you should never do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Valuing some ideas and concepts more than life. </li>
<li>Having a narrow perspective of life and dishonoring its diversity.</li></ul>


<p>The Remedy for terrorism is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inculcate a broader perspective of life -- value life more than race, religion and nationality.</li>
<li>Educate people  in human values � friendliness, compassion, cooperation and upliftment.</li>
<li>Teach methods to release stress and tension.</li>
<li>Cultivate confidence in achieving noble aims by peaceful and nonviolent means. </li>
<li>Create spiritual upliftment which can weed out destructive tendencies. </li></ul>


<p>Question: Can it be that terrorism need not be only physical violence, but also cultural or economical?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: Yes.</p>
<p>Solution for economic violence � "Think globally, buy locally." </p>
<p>Solution for cultural violence � "Broaden your vision, deepen your roots."</p>

<p>Question: How does one cope with the aftermath of terrorism?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: Faith and prayer. When disaster happens, anger is inevitable. To take precautions that one does not react wisdom is needed, not emotional outbursts. One mistake cannot be corrected by another mistake. Strive for multi-cultural and multi-religious education and spiritual upliftment to reach every part pf the globe. For the world will not be safe even if a small pocket of people are left ignorant. </p> 		</font>

</font></b><font face="Arial">
<p>Today many are anxious about how to deal with their anxiety!</p>

<p>Here are some of the ways you can manage your anxiety:</p>

<p>1. Sing, dance and celebrate. The very intention to celebrate will pull you away from anxiety to a more harmonious state.</p>
<p>2. Think about what you can do for others rather than just about yourself. Energize yourself with some service activity.</p>
<p>3. Combined practice of yoga, breathing and meditation.</p>
<p>4. Know the impermanence of the world.</p>
<p>5. Having faith and surrendering to the Divine and knowing that there is a supreme power who loves you. The supreme power is behind you and accepts you totally. The sense of security comes with the sense of belongingness.</p>
<p>6. Valour/courage: Invoking the lion within you and having an attitude of sacrifice will rescue you from anxiety.</p>
<p>7. Reminding yourself that you are committed to a greater goal will keep the anxiety away.</p>
<p>8. Being unpredictable for a while. Anxiety is always related to some anticipated action. Do something completely irrelevant and unpredictable.</p>
<p>9. Readiness to face the worst will leave you with stability in the mind.</p>
<p>10. Remembering a similar situation in the past when you were able to overcome your anxiety.</p>

<p>Violence and non-violence do not depend on the act but on the intention behind it. The basis of violence is anger, lust, hatred, jealousy, greed, frustration or aggression. </p>

<p>A surgeon cuts open a person's belly; so does a criminal. The action is similar. But the surgeon's intention is to save and the criminal's is to destroy. </p>

<p>Violence or non-violence is determined by the attitude and not the act.</p>

<p>Even a war can be non-violent if it is devoid of anger, hatred, jealousy or greed and it is for educating someone who cannot be educated in any other way. </p>

<p>Even charity can be an act of violence if it takes away self-esteem and inflicts slavery, and a war can be an act of compassion if it helps to put things in the right perspective. </p>

<p>Vijay: But isn�t dropping all intentions itself an intention?</p>

<p>While you sit for meditation you have to let the world be the way it is. The repetition of meditation is to habituate our system to be able to stop  and start activity at will. The ability to do this consciously is a very precious skill.</p> 		</font>

</b><p>Who is a volunteer? One who comes to help, without being asked to help; one who is self-motivated, inspired, becomes a volunteer.</p>
<p>There is the possibility of the inspirational motivation going down in a volunteer, which could bring frustration. </p>
<p>Usually volunteers come from the space of demand rather than humility � this dilutes the quality.</p>
<p>Another slack that could happen to a volunteer is that they could slip away from commitment, thinking there is no �boss� � "If I like it, I do it; if I don�t like it, I don�t!"  It is like the steering wheel of a car � if all the tires say they do not need steering, then the car cannot run smoothly. If you want to construct a building, you have to accept the authority of the structural engineer.</p>
<p>All these can only be overcome by being more grounded in spiritual knowledge. A volunteer devoid of spiritual dimension is utterly weak.</p>
<p>
1) A volunteer needs to stick to his commitment.<br>
2) The integrity in a volunteer comes from spiritual practices.<br>
3) The authority needs to be acknowledged.<br>
4) The strength of a volunteer comes from the challenges he is ready to willingly face.<br>
5) A volunteer moves beyond boundaries as he finds he is capable of doing so many things he never ever thought of doing.<br>
6) A true volunteer does not expect appreciation or reward.<br>
7) A volunteer has such a joy � that joy, itself, comes as the reward.<br>
8) If a volunteer thinks he is obliging somebody, he is thoroughly mistaken. He is �volunteering� because he derives so much joy out of it.</p>

<p>The joy is immediate � it does not come on the first of every month in the form of a salary!</p>
<p>When a volunteer realizes this, he is filled with gratitude.</p>
<p>When a volunteer waivers from within, the support system is knowledge and good friends.</p> 		</font>

<p>One of the rarest combinations in the human personality is the co-existence of confidence and humility. Often people who are confident are not humble and people with humility are not confident. </p>

<p>Confidence blended with humility is most appreciated by everybody.</p>

<p>Question: How can confidence be developed in one who is humble and humility in one who is confident?</p>

<p>Sri Sri:</p>
<ol>

<li>When you see your life from a bigger context of time and space, then you realize your life is nothing.</li>

<li>When you are humble you need to see that you are unique and dear to the Divine, which brings confidence, and when you realize you are insignificant, that brings confidence.</li>

<li>When you have a guru, you cannot be arrogant. Your guru gives you confidence and also brings humility in you. The weakness in humility and the arrogance in confidence are removed.</li></ol>

<p>Conducting Navchetna Shivirs, satsangs, creating awareness through cleanliness and&nbsp;tree-plantation drives our Yuvacharyas are busy transforming naxalite-hit villages into "model-villages". Many terrorists have also been transformed. Within a year 3,000 villages in India have been touched while the number of Yuvacharyas has gone up to 500. The confidence and commitment of the Yuvacharyas held everyone spellbound as they recounted&nbsp;success tales of alcohol-free, tobacco-free villages, and where love and belongingness are being nurtured. Immense numbers of legal cases have been withdrawn from courts, with warring factions agreeing to peaceful settlements, especially those involving "under-privileged" classes. Homes are being given to the needy, Sri Sri Ravishankar Vidya Mandirs opened where schools are not available. Tulsi, neem, genda, and other trees are being planted around homes and throughout villages. Two hundred and twenty four self-help groups have been formed while villagers are encouraged to practice savings. Villagers are celebrating&nbsp;festivals as one big family and&nbsp;human values are increasingly being nurtured.</p>

<p>Over a thousand participants are at the Advanced Course at Rishikesh where they are showered with blessings by a distinguished panel of Swamis at the Samapan Samaroh&nbsp; (closing ceremony). They also lauded Gurudev�s worldwide service projects.</p>

<p>1. Respect that comes to you because of your position, fame or wealth. This type of respect is impermanent. It can be lost once you lose your wealth or status.</p>

<p>2. Respect that comes because of your virtues like honesty, kindness, commitment, patience and your smile. This respect, no one can take away. </p>

<p>The less you are attached to your virtues, the more self respect you have. If you get attached to your virtues, you look down upon everybody else and they (the virtues) start diminishing. Non- attachment to virtues brings the highest self respect.</p>

<p>Often one confuses ego with self esteem. Ego needs the other for comparision, self esteem is just confidence in oneself. For example, a gentleman claims that he is thorough in Mathematics or Geography, this is self esteem. But to say that I know better than you, that is Ego. </p>

<p>Ego simply means lack of respect to the Self.</p>

<p>Ego upsets you very often. Self esteem is immune to getting upset by external factors. In self respect, everything is a game, winning or losing has no meaning, every step is joy, every move is celebration. </p>

</font>
<font face="Arial"><p>Question: Can space be measured?</p>
</font>
<font face="Arial"><p>Sri Sri: Only in space can things be measured. Space is the first dimension of measurement.</p>
<p>Measurement is always relative and not absolute. Example: If something weighs 6 kilos on the earth, it then weighs only 1 kilo on the moon. The light of the star you see today is not really today's light. It has taken at least 4 years for the light to reach you! Both size and weight change in air, water and earth. So "measure" is illusive and not dependable. Your bones, skin, body, environment and five elements can be measured; you can put a value to it. So, the whole world is Maya!</p>
</font>
<font face="Arial"><p>All measures are&nbsp;relative understanding. Einstein's theory of relativity correlates with the Advaita (non-dual) philosophy.</p>
</font>
<font face="Arial"><p>&nbsp;But what is not Maya? All that cannot be measured is not Maya. You cannot say 1 ounce of love, 2 ounces of peace, 5 kilos of happiness, Can YOU be measured? It is not possible. Your body has weight, but not YOU. Truth cannot be measured, Ananda (joy) cannot be measured, beauty cannot be measured. All these are part of Consciousness or Easwara (Divine) and are called MAYI.</p>

<p>Many have a problem of letting go of control. This results in anxiety, restlessness and it sours relationships. </p>
<p>Wake up and see, are you really in control? What are you in control of? Perhaps a tiny part of your waking state! Isn�t that so?</p>
<ul>
<li>You are not in control when you are sleeping or dreaming.
</li><li>You are not in control of thoughts and emotions coming to you. You may choose to express it or not, but they come to you without your prior permission!
</li><li>You realize that most of the functions of your body are not in your control, and the same for your life and the whole universe.
</li></ul>


<p>Similarly, do you think you are in control of all the events in your life or in the world? That is a joke!</p>
<p>When you look at things from this angle you need not be afraid of losing control, because you have none!</p>
<p>Whether you realise it or not, when you let go of your sense of control that is when you truly relax. Your identification of being somebody does not let you relax totally and it keeps your domain limited. </p> 		</font>

<p>What really perturbs you?  Isn�t it the foolishness that goes on around you?  </p>

<p>It is foolish to be perturbed by the foolishness.  Foolishness cannot overpower or annihilate wisdom nor does the foolishness stay all the time. When you are not well-founded in wisdom, then foolishness perturbs you, throws you out of balance.  When you create space for foolishness you do not get perturbed by it, rather you will laugh and move on. Otherwise you hate, get angry or become stressed by foolish acts.</p>

<p>When you know that truth is eternal and invincible you take foolishness as a joke and remain unmoved by it.  Those who are averse to foolishness or get irritated by it are members of the fools club. </p>

Such glory does not bring fulfillment for anyone� it is shallow.  Alternately, the dispassion that is afraid of glory is weak.  True dispassion is oblivious to glory.</p>

<p>The glory that comes with dispassion is something that is true, that is permanent and authentic.  When someone runs after glory they are shallow.  Like movie stars, politicians and religious leaders who try to hold on to their status, to their glory, they are certain to lose.  If you run after glory all you get is misery.  When you are dispassionate, glory comes to you.</p>

<p>If you are afraid of glory, that means you are not well-founded in dispassion.  In India, the Sadhus run away from glory.  They think they will lose their dispassion and get trapped in the web of the world, the circus.  The dispassion is so blissful, they get attached to the dispassion.  (laughter)</p>

<p>They are afraid of losing the dispassion, the centeredness and bliss that comes along with it.  This is weak dispassion.  Dispassion is a state of being and glory is the happening around it.  True dispassion can never be lost or overshadowed by glory.</p>

</font><font face="Arial"><p>Karthik: Is there something we should <i>not</i> be dispassionate about?</p>

<p>Guruji: Myself! (laughter)</p>

<p>Do not put off the fire of longing for the Divine or Satsang with Dispassion. </p>

<p>There is a little fire in you that propels you towards Knowledge, Sadhana, Devotion and Service. Sometimes you use Knowledge to put off that fire. The so-called dispassionate people are often morose and unenthusiastic. Many a times you hear people saying. " Oh, never mind, God is everywhere, Guruji is in my heart, you can do satsang anywhere. My Seva is my Sadhana, so no need to meditate, anyway I am doing Sadhana twenty-four hours. When God wills, he will call me to satsang and advanced courses again!"</p>

<p>Such excuses should not be justified as dispassion.</p>

<p>When you want to do some service, the mind goes,  "Oh, its all Maya, anyway everything is an illusion. It�s all just happening. Things will happen when the time comes!"</p>

<p> In this way Knowledge gets misused and is quoted out of context to suit one�s convenience or laziness. In the name of dispassion do not lose that spark of  enthusiasm and interest. Using Knowledge like this you miss out a lot. </p>

<p>Keep the fire of longing for the Divine and service to the society alive.   Dispassion here would be detrimental.</p> 		</font>

<p>Often business is looked down upon by spiritualists and spirituality is put off as non-practical by businessmen.  Spirituality is the heart, business is the legs, and that is what the ancient people conceived.  An individual or a society is incomplete without both these aspects.  Business brings material comfort and spirituality brings mental and emotional comfort.  Spirituality brings ethics and fair practice to business. In the body/mind complex depriving any one comfort means depriving both the comforts.  You cannot talk spirituality to the poorest of the poor people without taking care of their basic needs.  They need to be supported materially.  There is no spirituality in the world that is devoid of service and service cannot happen if material needs are ignored.  Service cannot happen only through the lips. For service to move you need legs. </p>

<p>Every system has its flaws.  As capitalism exploits the poor, socialism dampens individual creativity and entrepreneurial spirit.  Spirituality is the bridge between socialism and capitalism. Spirituality gives the heart to serve to the capitalists and the spirit to innovate to the socialist.  </p> 		</font>

<p>If we observe our behavior, we procrastinate doing something good but we are in a hurry when it comes to doing something bad. For example if we are angry we want to express it immediately and not wait. </p>

<p>Do you know WHY? Because virtues are your very nature and they will never leave you. Your vices are not your nature and they will leave you. The negative tendencies are transient and they will leave you if you do not act on them. Frustration, crying cannot stay for long, at least with the same intensity. Perhaps we are concerned that the vices will leave us if we do not act on them. </p>

<p>It is only wise to postpone the vices for they will not stay and act immediately for doing good, otherwise we will keep postponing the good for the next few lifetimes. (Laughter!!!)</p> 		</font>

  	    <b><p align="CENTER">Humor and Humiliation</p>
</b>
<p>Humor is the buffer that saves you from humiliation. If you have a good sense of humor you can never be humiliated. And if you refuse to be humiliated you become invincible. Humor brings everyone together, while humiliation tears them apart. In a society torn with humiliation and insult, humor is like a breath of fresh air. A good sense of humor relieves you from fear and anxiety.</p>

<p>Humor should be coupled with care and concern.  Mere humor without care and concern or appropriate action often irritates those who come to you with serious problems.</p>

<p>Humor can keep the spirit high, yet if overdone it leaves a bad taste. <br>
Humor without wisdom is shallow. <br>
Humor with wisdom creates an atmosphere of celebration.<br>
Humor without sensitivity is satire - it comes back to you with more problems. </p>

<p>The wise use humor to bring wisdom and to lighten every situation.<br>
The intelligent use humor as a shield against humiliation.<br>
The cruel use humor as a sword to insult others.<br>
The irresponsible use humor to escape from responsibility.<br>
And fools take humor too seriously!<br>
To make an effort to be humorous is nonsensical.<br>

</p><p>Question: How does one cultivate a sense of humor?</p>

<p>Sri Sri:</p>
<ol>
<li> Humor is not just words, it is the lightness of your Being. You do not have to read and repeat jokes -- just being cordial and light-hearted brings out authentic humor.
</li><li> Taking life itself not too seriously (because you will never come out of it alive!) (Laughter)
</li><li> Having a sense of belongingness with everybody, including those who are not friendly
</li><li> Practicing yoga and meditation
</li><li> Having unshakable faith in the Divine, and in the laws of karma
</li><li> Being in the company of those who live in knowledge and are humorous
</li><li> A willingness to be a clown

<p>Why would someone tell a lie to their close ones or to their beloved?</p>

<p>This is a question most often asked by lovers. Since love cannot stand untruth, this causes relationships to break up. The solution lies in understanding the paradox of love and truth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;People tell lies just to save and maintain their love. The fear that the truth might damage their love causes lies to be told between husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, parents and children and in family situations.</p>

<p>In love you feel weak and truth brings strength. Yet why do people prefer love over truth, i.e. weakness over strength?! (laughter)</p>

<p>&nbsp;No one wants to sacrifice love. Thus people are ready to give up the truth for their love. Love takes the luster out of truth. Sometimes truth can make love bitter while in love even lies can appear sweet, like Krishna�s lies to his mother Yashoda!</p>

<p>The truth that does not nourish love has no sense and the love that cannot withstand the truth is not true love. When one is assured that the love is so strong that the truth can neither break it nor cause bitterness, then the truth prevails and love shines. </p>

<p>Truth has judgments, but true love is beyond judgments. Thus true love makes you weak and yet it is the greatest strength. </p> 		</font>

<p>Guruji was exceptionally busy this week, meeting various leaders of the Muslim and Hindu communities late into the night to bring peace and harmony and a resolution of the Ayodhya issue. He convinced both the Muslim personal law board and the VHP to come on to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>There were remarkably interesting sessions on the AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) symposium on the Science of Breath, some of which Guruji Himself chaired. An international team of doctors presented their research findings to more than 1000 delegates. Synopsis and videos will be made available by May.</p>
<p>Guruji also went to an impromptu Satsang which was organized for Him at Tihar Jail. More than 4000 inmates who had already done the Prison SMART program greeted Him enthusiastically and He went among them and showered flowers of Grace on them.</p>
<p>He noticed that there were some very old women prisoners there, who could barely sit or stand by themselves, utterly incapable of committing any crimes, and He has made an appeal to the Governor to grant them amnesty.</p>
<p> He is now in Rishikesh �..</p>

<p>Shivaratri celebrations in Rishikesh truly took us to the peak of bliss and to silence beyond.

<p>Rest and happiness make a real holiday. Often people go on a holiday and they come back tired and tanned, and needing a few more days to recuperate! A real holiday is that which energizes and does not wear you out.&nbsp; Remember, nothing energizes you like Wisdom.</p>

<p>- &nbsp; Doubts and complaints are impediments for rest.</p>
<p>- &nbsp;The moment you set out on your holiday, know that it has begun.&nbsp; Often people expect to find a pinnacle of happiness.  Enjoy every moment of the journey as children do, do not wait for the destination.</p>
<p>- &nbsp;If you cannot be happy in one place, you cannot be happy in any other place. If you do not know how to row one boat you will not be able to row any other boat.</p>
<p>- &nbsp;To get maximum satisfaction out of your holiday you need to do something creative and engage in Seva.</p>
<p>- &nbsp;Do not ever forget to make meditation and prayer a part of your holiday.</p>

<p>When you are in a rush, you are unable to properly perceive things. Often you are in a rush in life. This takes away the charm, thrill and beauty from your life. You can never be close to the Truth when you are in a rush because your perception, observation and expression become distorted.</p>

<p>The rush to enjoy robs the joy from life. All the rush that you have in your life only denies the joy and freedom of here and now.</p>

<p>Often one does not even know why one is in a hurry. It almost becomes a biological phenomenon to be in a rush. Wake up and become aware of the rush in you!</p>

<p>Anne Farrow says: Wake up and slow down! (Laughter!)</p>

<p>It is ridiculous to be in a rush to slow down. Just being aware of the rush itself will take care of it. Slowing down does not mean lethargy or procrastination. It is easy to be in either extreme of being in a rush or being lethargic. </p>

<p>Feverishness arises out of lack, a need to achieve; whereas dynamism is an expression of fulfillment. </p>

<p>The golden rule is to be awake, and being awake you cannot help but be dynamic.</p> 		</font>

</font><font face="Arial"><p>A pure atheist is impossible to find. An atheist is one who does not believe in anything that is not concrete and tangible. Life is not all concrete and tangible. Nor is this Universe. Whether it is business, science or art, they all involve a certain amount of guesswork, assumptions, imagination and intuition. All of them are ethereal in nature and are not tangible. The moment an atheist accepts, even remotely a field that is unexplainable, he ceases to be an atheist.  Any intelligent person cannot rule out the mystery in life and the universe and hence cannot honestly be an atheist! The so-called atheists are perhaps only denouncing certain concepts of God.   </p>

<p>Question: Was Buddha an atheist?</p>

<p>Sri Sri: "No" in one sense because he professed emptiness which is very hard for an atheist to accept and "Yes" in another sense because he did not profess concepts of God. </p>

<p>Jim: An atheist believes only what he can see but Buddha said all that you see is not real. </p>

<p>There are two types of knowledge. 
The first one is pure knowledge and the second one is applied knowledge.
Applied knowledge may benefit you directly and immediately but pure knowledge benefits you indirectly in the long run.</p>
<b><u>
</u></b><p>If there are some things that you have studied or understood that you are unable to put into practice, do not get disheartened. Sometime in the future, if you do not discard the knowledge you have as impractical, it will be of use to you.</p>

<p>Often people discard the pure knowledge for its lack of immediate application. In fact these two types of knowledge compliment each other. Applied knowledge without pure knowledge remains weak.  And pure knowledge without application will remain unfulfilled.</p>

<p>Do not discard or label the knowledge as impractical. Do not label yourself as weak or unworthy because you are unable to apply the knowledge in your day-to-day life.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you are alone in nature, silent, taking a walk, looking at the sand on the beach, a bird in the sky, or while meditating  � suddenly the knowledge will emerge and you will recognize the knowledge dawning in your life. </p> 		</font>

<b><p align="CENTER"></p>
</b><p>There are several types of dispassion:</p>

<ol>

<li>You are dispassionate because you realize the misery in the world.  (You have a fear of misery.)  The events in life -- the pain, the suffering one experiences or sees -- brings dispassion.</li>

<li>The second type of dispassion is born out of the desire to reach something higher.  Some consider dispassion as a path to enlightenment.  If you renounce something here you gain something out there. Those who are seeking enlightenment practice austerities and take vows for a better place in heaven.  </li>

<li>The third type of dispassion comes out of wisdom or knowledge.  A broader understanding of the transient nature of things brings a state of non-attachment to any events, objects, people or situations that lets you remain calm and unperturbed.</li></ol>


<p>Divine love does not let the dispassion manifest.  The attainment of love brings such bliss and such intoxication, it not only takes away your passion, but dispassion as well.  </p>

<p>This is the problem with Art of Living members.  Many feel they have attained the highest and remain blissed out!  (laughter!)</p>

  	    <p align="CENTER"><b>FAITH AND ALERTNESS</b></p>

<p>Faith and alertness appear to be completely opposite in nature. When you are alert, usually there is no faith and you feel restless and insecure. When there is faith the mind is secure and rested and you are not alert.</p>

<p> There are three types of faith:</p>

<p>Tamasic faith which is because of dullness. Like when you do not want to take responsibility or action and you say, "Oh it doesn�t matter, anyway God will take care of all these things!"  (laughter) </p>

<p>Rajasic faith which is brought on by intense compulsion of desires and ambition. The ambition keeps the faith alive. </p>

<p>Satvic faith is innocent and is born out of fullness of consciousness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Faith and alertness, though apparently opposite in nature, are actually complementary to each other. In the absence of faith there can be no growth, and without alertness there can be no correct understanding. Faith can make you complacent. Alertness makes you tense.</p>

<p>If there is no faith, there is fear. And when there is no alertness one cannot perceive or express properly. A combination of both is essential. </p>

<p>In Gyana (state of wisdom) there is alertness without tension and faith without complacency. The purpose of education should be to remove the element of dullness from faith and the element of fear from alertness. This is a unique and rare combination. If you have faith and alertness at the same time, then you will become a true Gyani (the Wise One)!</p>

<p>What is enthusiasm? Enthusiasm means to be connected to God within. When you are with your source, you can only be enthusiastic. Apathy is when you are away from the source of life. You cannot be but enthusiastic when your mind is totally in the present moment. </p>

<p>You should know that dispassion is not apathy. It is simply a broader perspective of reality. Dispassion is moving towards the source. Dispassion simply means the way back home. It is the journey towards the source, which is a reservoir of enthusiasm. </p>

<p>When dispassion and enthusiasm co-exist, that is the secret of perennial enthusiasm and profound dispassion. Though they appear to be opposite, they are actually complementary. </p>

<p>1. What to do if your commitment is boring?</p>
<p>Commitment has value when things are not so charming. When things are interesting you do not need commitment at all. You never say you are committed to doing something that is very interesting or charming.</p>

<p>2. Learning is inevitable. By doing things right you learn, and by doing things wrong you also learn. From every situation, from everybody, you learn either what to do or what not to do. Either by mistakes or by doing things correctly, you cannot but learn. Learning is inevitable.</p>

<p>It is only when you sleep that you do not learn. And if you are asleep in your life, there is neither pain nor pleasure nor learning. Most people are in such deep slumber. That is why many people do not even make an effort to get out of pain.</p>

<p>3. Question: How to improve patience?</p>
<p>Sri Sri: Can I tell you next year?  (Laughter)</p>

<p>4. Question: How to improve memory?</p>
<p>Sri Sri: Ask me this question later.  (Laughter)</p>

<p>Normally in the world people with similar tendencies group together; intelligent people group together, fools get together, happy people get together, ambitious people get together and disgruntled people also group together to celebrate their problems! (Laughter) There is a saying, �Birds of a feather flock together.� </p>

<p>The disgruntled people get together, they complain and pull each other down. A frustrated person cannot be with someone happy because the other is not dancing to their tune. You only feel comfortable when the other person is in tune with you. Intelligent people do not feel at home with foolish people. Foolish people feel that intelligent ones are not humane. One with wisdom feels at home with the disgruntled as well as the happy, foolish and intelligent. Similarly, people with all these tendencies also feel at home with the wise.</p>

<p>Just turn around and look at what goes on in your group � are you grateful or grumbling? Take responsibility to uplift the people around you. That is Satsang, not just singing and leaving. </p>

<p>The wise person is like the sky where all birds can fly. </p>

  	    <b><p align="CENTER">FREE WILL AND DESTINY</p>
</b>
<p>When people consider the past as free will they are filled with remorse and regret.</p>

<p>When they consider the future as destiny, lethargy and inertia set in.</p>

<p>A wise person will consider the past as destiny and the future as free will.</p>

<p>When you consider the past as destiny, no more questions are raised and the mind is at ease.</p>

<p>And when you consider the future as free will you are filled with enthusiasm and dynamism.</p>

<p>Of course there will be some uncertainty when you consider the future as free will, and some anxiety, but it can also bring alertness and creativity.</p>

<p>Consider the past as destiny, the future as free will and the present moment as Divinity.</p>

<p>Question: How do we remove the anxiety?</p>

<p>Answer: By having faith in the Divine and doing sadhana.</p>

  		<b><p>News Flash:</p>
</b><p>The Art of Living played a leading role in the World Sustainable Development Summit 2002 held in Johannesburg, South Africa. Dean Harmison and his team were greatly appreciated. (More news to come)</p>

<p>More than 100 Art of Living volunteers from seven European countries came together to help flood victims in Dresden, Germany where huge floods have destroyed all that people once had. Many volunteers worked through the night to free houses from the mud. The mayor of Pirna/Dresden and the leading military officer there have expressed their gratitude to the Art of Living volunteers.</p>

<p>Currently, free Art of Living Breath-Water-Sound and ART Excel courses are being conducted for the victims.</p>

<p>And finally, Guruji celebrated Lord Krishna's birth in Hyderabad with a grand satsang.  He then proceeded to Nagpur.</p>
