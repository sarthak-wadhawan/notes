  "text": "This begins a new practice of weekly dispatches of Knowledge from Guruji. Every center around the world will receive the Knowledge so it can be read for people to copy down at weekly Satsang. Here is the first segment Guruji dictated at Big Sur, 21 June, 1995. * * * * Beyond an event is Knowledge. Beyond a person is love. Beyond an object is infinity. Knowledge is not in an event; it is beyond an event. If you take one event and infer anything from one event -- infer knowledge -- it will be erroneous knowledge. Say Nancy gets angry and shouts at someone. You attribute anger to Nancy, but actually it was carried from someone else to her. Someone else got angry first and someone else and someone else and on and on like that. When you go beyond an event, only then the truth dawns. One particular event gives you a false notion. So you have to consider the totality of events, the totality of all events infinitely. Beyond the event is Knowledge. What do we call a person? A person is a body, a mind, a complex of behaviors which is changing. Love is unchanging. Beyond the person is love. When you lose your personality, you become love. If you cannot lose yourself, you cannot find yourself. So, lose your personality; you'll find yourself!!! Behind every object is infinity. An object is limited. Take an object and reduce, reduce, reduce, and you have an atom. An atom is infinity. Each atom contains infinite space. Beyond the object is infinity. The object behind the object is infinity. The person behind the person is love. Maya is getting caught up in the event, personality, object. Knowledge, love, Brahman is seeing beyond the event, personality, or object. See? Just a little shift. JAl GURU DEV",

  "title": "CLOSE TO THE MASTER",
  "text": "If you're not feeling close to the Guru, it's because of you. Because of your mind, because of your ego concepts. Share with the Guru that which is very important or intimate to you. Share that. Do not feel shame, shy, or judgmental about yourself. Unless you express to the Master that which is very intimate and important to you, just being on the formal and informal communication levels cannot make you feel close. \"How are you, where are you going? How have you been?\" Stop formal and superficial conversations with the Master and speak with your heart that which is very important and intimate, very deep to your life. Don't just say how much the squash costs, 30 cents or whatever. If you don't feel close to the Master, there's no point in having a Master. It is just another burden to you. You have enough already. Just say \"Goodbye,\" get rid of it. Question: When you play little games and push us away, how can we feel close to you? Answer: You should feel more close if you are pushed away, scolded or ignored. Because to ignore somebody takes a lot of effort. When a Master does not even ignore wrapping paper, or a flower that is in a vase, how can he ignore a walking, talking, breathing human being who is connected? How could that be ignored? So when you understand this, you already feel close. Question: Can we call you every week? Response from the room: Call Guruji every week and if he doesn't answer the phone then you know you are loved. Answer: Yes, put that in. \t(Laughter) You are with the Master to share the joy of the Master, to share the consciousness of the Master. For that, you have to empty your cup of what is already in it. So you share that with the Master. You share whatever you have and don't judge, \"Oh, that is garbage.\" The Master is ready to accept any garbage of any extent. However you are, he will embrace you. He is ready to share. You only have to share from your side.",

Prabdha karma cannot be changed. Sanchita karma can be changed by spiritual practices. Satsang burns the seed of all negative karma. When you praise someone, you take on their good karma.

  "title": "ONLY SPEAK KNOWLEDGE",
  "text": "Only speak Knowledge. Don't repeat anything that someone tells you or opinions about anyone that someone states -- \"That so-and-so said such-and-such about you.\" If someone comes to tell you such things, discourage them. Don't believe it. If someone blames you directly, know that they are taking away your bad karma and let it go. Don't believe in it, and if you're one of the Guru's close ones, you will take all of the blame of the world with a smile. Conflict is the nature of the world; comfort is the nature of the self. Amidst the conflict seek the comfort. When you are bored with the comfort, get into the games of the world. When you are tired of the games of the world, get into the comforts of the Self. If you are one of the Guru's close ones, you do both simultaneously. Trying to end conflict prolongs it. Face the conflict by seeking the comfort of the Self. God is alive in the world and has been putting up with all the ongoing conflicts throughout the ages. If God can put up with all the conflicts, you can too. The moment you agree to be with the conflict, the conflict disappears. People who love peace do not want to fight, and those who fight do not love peace. Those who want peace want to run away. What is needed here is to be peaceful within and then fight. The whole message of the Gita is to be peaceful yourself and then fight. Krishna tells Arjuna to fight but be in peace at the same time. Does this ring a bell? In the world, you resolve one conflict and another one comes up. For example, Russia is solved and then Bosnia arises. You make one better, and then another starts up. Your body gets a cold, then you get better; then your back hurts, then it gets better. Your body gets better, and then the mind goes. The world runs like this, isn't it? Without any intention, misunderstandings happen. It's not up to you to try to resolve them. Ignore them and be alive.",

  "title": "MASTER IS A DOORWAY",
  "text": "Master is a doorway. And the doorway needs to be more charming than the world so that you will come to the doorway. Someone is in the street and there is rain, thunder, hot sun; they need shelter. They look around, they find a doorway. They come to the doorway. The doorway is more inviting, more charming, more celebrative, more joyful than anything else in the world. Nothing could give that much peace, joy, pleasure in the world. Once you come to the doorway, you enter the door and see the world from there. See the world from the eyes of the Master. This is a sign that you have come to the Master. Otherwise you may still be standing in the street and looking at the door. But once you have entered the door, then you will see the whole world from the eyes of the Master. This means what? In every situation that you face, you will think, \"If this situation comes in front of the Master, how would he handle it?\" or \"How would she handle it?\" \"If this complication comes in front of the Master, how would he take it?\" \"If someone blames the Master like this, how would he handle it?\" See the world from the eyes of the Master all the time. The world looks much more beautiful; not a nasty place. But a place filled with love, filled with joy, cooperation, compassion, and all virtues. The world is much more fun. Looking through the doorway, there is no fear. You will look at the world without any fear. You will be in all relationships with everybody without any fear. Because there is shelter. From inside home, you will look at the thunder, you will look at the storm, you will look at the rain, you will look at the bright sun. Inside you have air conditioning. Very cool, pleasant. Outside it's hot. You donÒ´ mind because there is nothing that can really distract you, disturb you, or take the fullness away from you. Such a sense of security, such a sense of fullness and joy comes. That is the purpose of having a Master. All relationships in the world go topsy-turvy. You make relationships and you break relationships. All relationships can get broken or made up and again broken. And there is craving and aversion. This is the world. This is samsara. But the Master is not a relationship. The Master is the Presence. What is necessary is to feel the Presence of the Master, not to make a relationship. Don't make the Master a part of your world. Then the same, \"Oh, he looked at me.\" \"He didn't look at me.\" \"Oh, he said this.\" \"He didn't say that.\" \"Oh, somebody is close. I am not close.\" All this garbage comes into it. You feel the Presence of the Master, that is eternal. That has been there with you before, now, and will be there in the future, too. Master is the Presence. World is relativity. And relativity has limitations. Presence is unlimited. Presence is vast, infinite, and all comprehensive, all inclusive. And the presence of the Master in one's life will bring fulfillment to all relations. Every relationship will become complete with the presence of the Infinity if the Master is in your life.",

See, the eyes are dark, eyebrows are dark, the thymus -- the most powerful organ of the body -- is black. Hemoglobin -- the main force of the body -- is black. You cannot survive without black. It is part of you. Or see it as white. Eye is also white. Bones are white; the structure on which the whole body stands is white. Put it in a category of black -- no problem -- accept. Put it in a category of white -- no problem -- doubt is not there. Have conviction. \"I accept. They are dishonest and still part of me.\" That's it. Finished.

But if you burn sandalwood, it creates fragrance. Celebration happens around the bonfire. Grief happens around the fire of cremation. The same fire that supports life in winter, can also destroy. One fire, like a ghee lamp, lights your way and purifies. Another fire made of toxic material creates pollution. You are also like fire. Are you the fire that creates smoke and pollution or the flame of camphor which creates light and fragrance? A saint is like a camphor flame that creates light and the fragrance of love. He is the friend of life. The fire that creates light and warmth and is useful is of higher quality. The fire that creates light and a little smoke as well is of medium quality. The fire that creates darkness and only smoke is of low quality. Learn to distinguish the different fires. If your senses are engaged in goodness, then you will create light and fragrance. If engaged in impurity, you create smoke and darkness. It issamyamathat transforms the quality of fire in you. Next week we will discusssamyama.",

  "title": "HABITS AND VOWS",
  "text": "How to get rid ofvasanas(impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits. You want to get rid of habits because they give pain and restrict you. The nature ofvasanais to bother you, or bind you, and wanting to be free is the nature of life. Life wants to be free and when a soul doesn't know how to be free, it wanders through lifetimes wanting freedom. The way to come out of habits is vows. This issamyama. Everybody is endowed with a littlesamyama. A vow should be time bound. This would bring good conduct and save you from being wayward. Consider the time and place for vows to be taken. When the mind dwells on useless thoughts, then two things happen. One is that all those old patterns come up and you feel discouraged by them. You blame yourself and feel that you have not made any progress. The second thing is that you see it as an opportunity forsamyamaand feel happy about it. Withoutsamyama,life will not be happy and diseases arise. For example, you know you should not eat three servings of ice cream, or eat ice cream every day, or otherwise you will get sick. Habits will clog you when there is no liveliness or juice in life. When there is a direction for life force, you can rise above habits throughsamyama. Take vows according to time and place. For example, suppose someone has a habit of smoking cigarettes and says, \"I will quit smoking,\" but cannot do it. They can take a vow, three months or 90 days; a time-bound vow. If someone is used to cursing and swearing, take a vow not to use bad language for ten days. Don't take it for a lifetime; you will break it immediately. If you happen to break it in between, don't worry. Just begin again. Slowly increase the duration until it becomes your nature. All those habits which bother you, bind them in vows, insamyama. So all those who are in Satsang, take a time-bound vow today and make a note of it. If you break a vow, make a note of it and share the time and date at the next Satsang. Continue it again. Tie those habits which bring you pain insamyama.",

  "title": "DEALING WITH BLAME",
  "text": "When someone blames you, what do you usually do? Blame them back or you put up resistance in yourself. When someone blames you, they actually take away some negative karma from you. If you understand this and don't put up resistance and feel happy about it, then you drop your resistance. \"Oh, good. That person is blaming me. Good. Something is going away.\" And when you drop the resistance, your karma goes away. Do you see what I'm saying? So when someone blames you and you put up resistance in your mind, and you don't react, then you are not allowing them to take the negative karma. Outside you may resist, but inside if you don't resist, and feel happy, \"Oh, good, somebody is there to blame me and take some negative karma,\" you will feel immediately lighter. How does it feel to you when someone blames you? Do you feel some heaviness? Usually, when someone blames you, you feel hurt and you feel unhappy, you feel sad. This is all because you're . . . resisting. That is it. What you resist, persists. The ignorant person tells someone, \"Don't blame me because it hurts me.\" An enlightened person also says \"Don't blame me.\" Do you know why? Because it might hurt you. This is a beautiful point. What are the points? You get hurt because you resist the blame. When someone blames you, you resist it inside. Outside you may not resist, but inside when you resist, then that hurts you. An ignorant person warns you, \"You better not hurt me, you better not blame me because I will feel hurt.\" Someone warns you not to blame them because it will hurt them and they'll do something harmful to you out of revenge. An enlightened person says \"Don't blame me because it will hurt you.\" So here you say, don't blame because of compassion. You can tell someone, don't blame me out of compassion, or you can say it out of anger.",

  "text": "BIRTH OF THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION Krishna means the most attractive . . . It is the divinity that is the most attractive; the energy that pulls everything to it. Krishna is the formless center which is everywhere. Any attraction from anywhere is coming only from Krishna. Often people fail to see the spirit behind the attraction and merely hold on to the outer shell. And the moment you try to possess the shell, you will see Krishna has played a trick and you will be left with an empty shell in your hands and tears in your eyes. Be clever like Radha -- don't be tricked by Krishna. Krishna could not escape from Radha, for her whole world was filled with Krishna. If you can see that wherever there is an attraction, there is Krishna; then you are Radha, you are in your center. The mind moves towards beauty, joy and truth. Krishna tells Arjuna, \"I am the beauty in the Beautiful, the strength in the Strong, the wisdom in the Wise.\" In this way he arrests the mind from moving away from him. Krishna reveals this Knowledge to Arjuna because he isAnasuya. Next week we will see what isAnasuya.",

If a mirror is dusty, you need a duster to clean it. But if your eyes have a cataract, any amount of dusting will not help. So first you have to remove the cataract. Then you can see that the mirror is already clean. There is a certain mind set that always finds fault, even in the best conditions in the world. When you give a person with this mind set the best, they still find faults. Even with the best possible companion, or the most beautiful painting, they will still find something wrong. That kind of mind set cannot know the sacred Knowledge. Krishna tells Arjuna that he is giving him the Royal Secret, because he isanasuya. \"You are not finding fault in Me, even though you are so close.\" From a distance, even craters cannot be seen. Even on a smooth surface there will be holes. If you are only interested in the holes, you will not see the magnanimity of things. If you are not inanasuya, Knowledge cannot blossom in you. Then there is no point in giving Knowledge. Question: What about discrimination -- Wisdom? Answer: If it is in your vision, your vision will find discrimination. The moment you are out of the path, everything is all wrong, that is notanasuya. For example, you have a friendship, and after 10 years you decide to leave. When you leave, you do not see the good in that relationship. You find fault. This is notanasuya. However, once you discover you have the wrong vision, half of the wrong vision has already disappeared. There is a fine line here. There cannot be any better example than the cataract. Instead of saying, \"My vision is blurred,\" you say, \"The whole world is not sharp.\" Suppose someone is coming in. It is windy, so you shut the door. But the person thinks the door has been slammed in his face! This isasuya. It is notanasuya. Most of the population is like this. Asuyais finding fault. It is seeing malicious intent everywhere. It is like a child who says, \"Mother, you don't love me!\" The child's vision is wrong. If the mother does not love the child, who will? It is the same as if someone comes and says, \"Guruji, you don't love me!\" If I don't love them, forget about it. Nobody else in the world will! Where else will they find love? Nowhere. A mother may get frustrated but not a Master. Question: It seems as though you can't haveanasuyaunless you are enlightened? Answer: Not always. This is an excuse. To get enlightenment, you must have this vision.",

  "title": "THE LOVE OF THE IGNORANT AND THE ANGER OF THE ENLIGHTENED",
  "text": "The love of the ignorant can be harmful yet even the anger of the Enlightened is not harmful. It can be only good! An example is the school at the Art of Living Ashram in Bangalore. 250 children are enrolled but only 200 come to class on any given day. Fifty children don't show up. Why? They cry at home, \"Mother, I don't want to go to school.\" The mother says, \"Oh, la la, don't cry . . . ok.\" She thinks, \"No child in the world is like my child.\" And so she sticks up for the child and begins to speak for him. She does not see the teacher's point of view. The mother asks the teacher, \"Why are you not teaching my child properly? He is so innocent, so lovely.\" So, what happens -- the child grows up spoiled. The love in the mother's ignorance has spoiled the child. The child will never learn the alphabet, never learn to read or write, but the mother says, \"Oh, never mind, there are sheep to look after and fields to tend.\" The mother's love in ignorance has spoiled the child. The anger of the Enlightened is a blessing. There are many instances of this in thePuranas. Once a Master was traveling in the middle province of India with a disciple following him a few yards behind. Some boys who were rude, rough, and abusive began to throw stones and tease the disciple calling him names. This went on for some time as the boys followed the Master and the disciple. They came to a river. The Master and the disciple got into a boat in order to cross. The boys got in another boat which started to sink in the middle of the river. The Master slapped the disciple across the face. The disciple was so surprised as he had not said a word back to the boys in response to their taunts. He had been such a good disciple and yet the Master had slapped him! The Master said, \"It is your fault. You are responsible for their boat sinking. You did not respond to their abuse. Nature has now punished them in a worse way because you did not have enough compassion to quell their insults.\" The slap that the Master gave took away the karma of this event such that it would not be carried into the future of the boys. It also served to take away any little bit of joy the disciple may have felt at seeing the boys' boat sink! Thus, it also took away the karma of the event for the disciple. So, the anger of the Enlightened is a blessing!",

But are they free? Discipline protects freedom. They both go hand in hand. Understand this and go ahead in life. You have some restrictions and it is this that allows you freedom. You can choose to focus either on freedom or discipline, and this makes you happy or unhappy. Freedom without discipline is like a country without a defense. Fences should be fences; a fence cannot be built all over the property. If your fence is all over, how can you build on the property? That state of high absolute freedom is too difficult; we need to be very practical. Yes, there is a state of unlimited bliss, the freedom Advaita talks about. The Advaita Knowledge has been totally misused or used according to one's own fancies and conveniences. There must be awareness in the mind, love in the heart, and righteousness in action. Love and fear are two possibilities that put you on track. The Jewish religion put fear as the main thing so that life could improve. Nature induces fear at a certain age in a child. When a child is very young, it gets 100 percent time and love of the mother. The child has no fear. As the child grows more independent it becomes cautious. Nature brings in an iota of fear.

  "text": "ASHISHYA(DISCIPLE) OR ASAKHA(COMPANION)? Knowledge has an end. Knowledge completes. So also does discipleship. For the disciple is aimed at acquiring Knowledge. Once you cross the water, however nice the boat is, you get off the boat. After twelve years, the disciple completes his studies. The master does a ceremony calledSamavartha, where he tells the disciple that he is ending the discipleship and asking him to behave at par with him, and let theBrahmandynamically manifest. Sakhais a companion in life and death; it never ends. In the path of love there is neither beginning nor end.Sakhaonly wants the beloved. He doesn't care about the Knowledge or liberation. Love is incomplete because of longing. And so it is infinite, for infinity can never be complete. Arjuna was asakhato Krishna and although Krishna was the perfect Master he was asakha,too. What are you, ashishya(disciple) or asakha(companion)?",

  "text": "There are three things: the Self, the senses, and the object, or the world. And there are three words:sukha, pleasure;dukha, sorrow; andsakha, companion. These have one thing in common: \"kha,\" which means \"senses.\" The Self through the senses experiences the world. When the senses are with the Self, that is pleasure (sukha), because the Self is the source of all joy or pleasure. When the senses are away from the Self (dukha) -- in the mud, lost in the object -- that is misery. Mud, misery, mind -- they are very close. Self      ---      Senses (\"Kha\")     ---      World ---     Joy (Sukha)           Sorrow (Dukha)     --- Self is the nature of joy. In any pleasant experience, you close your eyes; you smell a nice flower, or you taste or touch something. Sosukhais that which takes you to the Self.Dukhais that which takes you away from the Self. Sorrow simply means that you are caught up in the object, which goes on changing, instead of focussing on the Self. All the sense objects are just a diving board to take you back to the Self. Thesakhais the companion who is there in both the experiences of thedukhaand ofsukha. It means one who leads you back to the Self. If you are stuck in an object, that wisdom which pulls you back to the Self issakha. Knowledge is your companion and your companion is Knowledge. And the Master is nothing but the embodiment of Knowledge. Sosakhameans, \"He is my senses, I see the world through that wisdom, through Him.\" If your sense is the Divine, then you see the whole world through the Divinity. Your head will be in the mud in a few years; Don't put mud in your head while you are still alive.",

  "title": "SCEPTICISM",
  "text": "Ignorance is being a sceptic and not knowing you are a sceptic. If you think you are a sceptic, you are no longer a sceptic because you have a clue of something beyond. So, in reality, you can never know whether you are a sceptic or not! A sceptic is stuck in a paradigm and closes all other possibilities. But this creation is of all possibilities. As one understands the paradigm shift, scepticism is removed. A real scientist can never afford to be a sceptic because scepticism closes down possibilities and does not continue to probe into unknown areas of existence. In short, scepticism is an \"I know it all\" attitude, and this attitude is unscientific. Scepticism is dispelled by Knowledge. Perception and inference are two means of knowing. In every human being deep inside, there is faith and love. What you think is scepticism is only a thin layer. If you hold in your mind that they are sceptics you empower their scepticism. Do not recognize someone's scepticism and try to argue with them. Argument strengthens their scepticism. Fear of interference in one's freedom brings more resistance and causes scepticism. Your silence and the smile from your heart will dispel their scepticism. There is nothing better than silence to break scepticism. Silence means the quality of consciousness, not just keeping lips tight. Scepticism doesn't come up in children. It comes only with people who walk with boundaries. Children have no scepticism. They live in their fantasy world, a world of many possibilities. Their world is one of innocence, joy, beauty, and so much love.",

  "title": "SHAUCHA AND ASHAUCHA",
  "text": "When you are miserable, what has happened is that you have gone away from the Self. This is calledAshaucha. It means you have become unclean. In India when someone dies, the close relatives are said to beAshauchafor 10 days because they are very sad. They are impure because they have moved away from the self. After 10 days of just being with that experience and reading the Gita, being with the Knowledge and pulling themselves back into the Self, then it is calledShaucha. They have purged out the impurities that have come during events. This keeps happening again and again in dealings in life. You becomeAshauchaand you have to get back toShaucha. Go deeper in to yourself, then realShauchahappens. Shaucha'sbenefits are clarity in the intellect, a pleasing mind, focused awareness in the mind, a say over the senses, and therefore eligibility to realize the Self. Shauchais disinterestedness in the tendencies of one's own senses and non-association with other people. If a tendency in your body arises just have the understanding, \"Oh yes, here is this old familiar tendency coming up again. Come on, you have had this experience enough, and still the body is craving for it again.\" Disinterestedness in one's own body -- just an idea, a sort of distaste, and in one moment it changes. Why do people love each other so much, have such an intimate relationship, and then fight?Ashauchahas happened. If you don't get distaste for the tendency of the senses then distaste for the object of the senses will come and you will blame the object. WhenAshauchahappens then come back toShauchaquickly. Suppose you get drowned in any worldly aspect, just know this isAshaucha. . . \"That is why I am suffering misery.\" Then come back toShaucha. Your attraction or craving is only as long as you think someone is \"other.\" When you think they are part of you or your Self, then the attraction dies out. That is why a husband or wife is not attracted to the partner but to someone else because the partner has already become a part of them. When you realize everyone is part of your Self, you enjoy the whole world without a sense of craving.",

You are so used to talking gossip. Now for two weeks, talk Knowledge, especially to those not coming to Satsang. Even on the phone -- suppose you can't find someone at seven o'clock; call someone on the phone and talk Knowledge for a couple of minutes: \"What are you doing? What do you want? How can I help you?\" Praise the Divine. This is an exercise. Every day for ten minutes, do individual Satsang and skillfully talk ten minutes of Knowledge.

In the second case, you don't get permanent relief, as another bigger vehicle might come in front of you. Like that, running away from events is not the permanent solution. However, wise people use their skill and grow over the events. If the vehicle is in perfect condition, the skill is effective. Conditioning the vehicle issadhanaor practice.

Likepurana.It means \"that which is new in the town, the most modern.\" But it is used in the sense of being old. In the course of time, meanings of words change. The word \"enthused\" comes from the Greek which means \"God is with us.\" Then it came to mean crazy, and now it's changed again. Don't be stuck with the words. Your worries are words. Your ideas are words. Wisdom is beyond words. It is the very Being. It is the essence of all words. See and relate beyond words. Then there is no lie in your life. If you manipulate words, it is a lie. If you play on words, it is a joke. If you rely on words, it is ignorance. If you transcend words, it is wisdom.",

The way to expand from individual to universal consciousness is to share others's sorrow and joy. As you grow, your consciousness should also grow. When you expand in Knowledge with time, then depression is not possible. Your inner most source is joy. The way to overcome personal misery is to share universal misery! The way to expand personal joy is to share universal joy. Instead of thinking \"what about me?\" \"what can I gain from this world?\" think \"what can I do for the world?\" When everyone comes from the point of contributing to society, you have a Divine society. We have to educate and culture our individual consciousness in order to expand in time with the Knowledge . . . from \"what about me?\" to \"what can I contribute?\" If you are not having good experiences in meditation, then do more seva -- you will gain merit and your meditation will be deeper. When you bring some relief or freedom to someone through seva, good vibrations and blessings come to you. Seva brings merit; merit allows you to go deep in meditation; meditation brings back your smile. That something which is so precious to you is your smile -- your joy. You lose it in the world and find it in the self, in Satsang. If you can't find it here, at the Ashram, forget about it. Your can't find it anywhere.",

If judgements are lighter like air, like a breeze, they bring in fragrance, then move away. They could bring a foul smell, then move away. They should not stay there forever. Judgements are so subtle that you are not even aware of their existence. Judging or labeling someone as judgmental is also a judgement. Only in the state of Being when you are full of love and compassion can you ever be free from all judgements. Yet the world cannot move without judgements. Until you judge something as good or bad, you cannot do any actions. If you see rotten apples in the market, you say, \"No good.\" Good ones you buy. If someone lies to you ten times, you think next time it also could be a lie. A judgment happens automatically. See the possibility that people and things can change at any time and don't hold onto the judgements. You need to judge your company. Your company can pull you up or pull you down. The company that drags you towards doubt, dejection, blame, complaints, anger, delusion, and desires is bad company. The company that pulls you up towards joy, enthusiasm, service, love, trust, and Knowledge is good company. When someone complains, first you listen, then you nod, then you sympathize, then you complain.

Most people have a small imagination and are stuck with that, and that causes frustration. But if you are a devotee, you say \"Let Thy Will be done\" and then you will step lightly to the goal. You will take it easy. We have to make a distinction. Some people say \"Let God do everything and surrender\" and others say \"I have to be responsible.\" Surrender is saying \"Let Thy Will be done\" and \"Thy Will\" for you is to take responsibility for the whole world. It appears to be opposing and conflicting in nature -- in fact they are two sides of the same coin. The more you surrender, the more responsive you become. One who is irresponsible cannot surrender either. Why is someone irresponsible? They are lazy or fearful or both. If you are lazy or fearful, you cannot be in love. Total responsibility is total surrender. It's a little hard to chew, but this is the truth. People usually say either I take responsibility or surrender, but I tell you they go hand in hand. Suppose you are surrendered to the Knowledge. That means you are committed to sharing it with others. You take responsibility to see that it flourishes. Question: The confusion comes with the doership? Answer: When you are taking responsibility and you find blocks, remember \"surrender.\" That gives you strength to move ahead. It releases you from the weight of the doership. Responsibility is the dynamic expression of life in the present moment. When you are shaken, remember the basis of responsibility as surrender. Taking responsibility or surrendering without doership is the skill of the wise. Total irresponsibility is impossible for you. Limited responsibility makes you weak. A little water in the sun will evaporate but the ocean never dries up. Limited responsibility tires you out. Unlimited responsibility empowers you and brings you joy.",

The solar plexus has a profound impact on the central nervous system, optic nerves, stomach, and what we usually call \"gut feeling.\" It is the second brain in your body. Usually the solar plexus is slightly bigger than an almond. Studies have shown that with the practice of yoga, meditation, and Sudarshan Kriya, the solar plexus can become as a large as the size of the palm. Then it performs better. It balances the body functions. When the solar plexus expands, the intuitive mind works better. The mind becomes clear and focussed. When the solar plexus contracts, one feels horrible, sad, depressed, and all the negative feelings come. Krishna was called Padmanabha, meaning \"whose navel is the size of a lotus flower.\" If you become Padmanabha, you become absolutely creative.

From certain stones which are good to carve, the sculptor makes the walls and pillars of the Temple. From other stones he makes the steps. Certain stones become the tower of the Temple. Only those stones which are extremely suitable for carving will become the Deity and be installed in the Temple. When the stone become a part of the Temple, it no longer remains a stone, it becomes a sculpture, a piece of art, it becomes the Living Deity. In the same way many people come to the Master.  According to the degree of their surrender they are installed by the Master. All are essential. If there were no steps, how could a person reach the Temple? If there were no foundation, how could the Temple be there at all? What can a tower do without pillars? For a sculptor, each stone is precious and valuable.",

Children take each object they play with and make it totally personal. Even a stone has a face; even the sun laughs. When you attach emotion, the whole creation becomes personal.  When you remove the emotion, even people become objects. Violence is removing the emotion.  How a person can kill another person: it is when they do not see them as a person, they see them as an object. But even a stone attracts reverence when it becomes personal. Dean says: In military training they teach soldiers to see people as killing objects coming toward you that need to be killed first. Susannah says: In the temple even a stone is elevated to the level of spirit. The impersonal cannot attract reverence. Most people see God as impersonal and therefore they do not progress. Dean and Susannah say: \"That's why we need a Guru!\" Chan says: When we say something isn't real, then it's impersonal. When we personalize something, we make it real. So then, what is reality? You are the Reality. You are not the thoughts, you are not the emotions nor actions. You are not even a person...! Exercise: What you now see as impersonal, see it as personal.

(Laughter and amazement) When people respect you, they often take away your freedom. They expect you to smile at them, recognize them, behave in a certain way with them. If they don't respect you, you are not obliged to answer their questions and you can drop all the formalities. Either you will be naturally smiling or frowning. So you will be complete. When people love and respect you, you are obliged to return their courtesies because you don't want to hurt them. When they don't respect or love you, they will not be hurt by your actions and expressions. So they set you free. When you gain respect, you often do it at the cost of your freedom. Wisdom is to put the freedom first and not bother about respect. Q: Will freedom not bring arrogance? A: True freedom is not an \"I don't care\" attitude. It is lightness from within, a genuine smile and not stiffness. When someone is stiff and arrogant, they are not really free. True love blossoms only in such freedom.

In fact, it is the sacrifice which makes life worth living. The amount of sacrifice in your life brings out your magnanimity and helps you move out of misery. A life without sacrifice is worth nothing. Zeal, enthusiasm, strength and joy are all connected to sacrifice. Question: Some people say, \"I have sacrificed so much,\" and complain. Answer: That is good. The thought of sacrifice has given them strength to complain and saves them from blaming themselves without which they would even be more depressed.

So you analyze from the relative world and synthesize to find the one. The intellect divides to find the truth. Truth once found synthesizes everything. When the intellect becomes quiet, it brings out the intelligence. Often people think that gathering information makes one intelligent. This is not so. It is the \"samadhi\" which brings out the intelligence. An unintelligent man, in spite of having all the information, cannot be creative. An intelligent man without much information can be creative. A sign of intelligence is to see the one in many and find the many in one. There is an old Sanskrit proverb: The first sign of intelligence is not to start anything. The second sign of intelligence is if you have started something, you have to continue it to the end. If you have annoyed somebody, don't stop it in the middle, take him to the edge.

From time to time in different phases, different faces appear. As you come close to your Being, all the faces melt and leave you as the Space that you are. At the gross level, you identify yourself as somebody. At a subtle level, you identify yourself as some energy or an incarnation of some angel, saint or prophet. When you go beyond even this identity, you are whole, holy, Brahman - Purna Brahman Narayana.",

  "text": "Celebration Celebration Is Pure Vibration Human life is a combination of matter, i.e., body and spirit or vibration. Isn't it? Pleasure or joy is becoming intense vibration. Joy is forgetting that you are matter and so you become intense vibration. All the carnal instincts will also make you feel intense vibrations momentarily. And that's how they give a glimpse of joy. But the thing is, it is short lived and it makes you dense later on. Pleasure that comes from Satsang is of a higher nature. Mantra and singing create vibrations in the spirit. That's why when you sing, the ecstasy stays for a long time. Pleasure in the subtle is long lasting, energizing, refreshing and freeing. Pleasure from the gross is short lived, tiring and binding. When you know you are electricity (vibration/energy), then craving, greed, lust and anger disappear. And you become true celebration. There were lots of gifts around Sri Sri's couch. John asked Sri Sri, \"Are you going to open the gifts?\" Sri Sri winked and pointed at the people and said, \"I am always opening the gifts.\" (Laughter) Your life is a gift. And you have come to unwrap the gift. In the process of unwrapping, you also save the wrappers. Your whole environment, situations, circumstances and body are the wrapping papers. When we unwrap, we destroy the wrapping paper. We are in such a hurry at times that we even destroy the gifts. With patience and endurance, open your gifts and save the wrapping papers.",

The more relief they bring, the happier they feel. And people who are selfish and who just want to enjoy themselves will be miserable even in good times. Often the organizers of a party do not enjoy the party because some little thing is missing, they forgot to invite somebody, somebody did not come or some little thing went wrong. A wise one is happy even in bad times. And the stupid one is unhappy even in good times. Like weather, time has its own impact on you. But your Satsangs and sadhana are your shield, your protection! So realize that you are more than time and that you can move the time by your connection to the Divine. Don't feel shy to speak about human and spiritual values. Time has come now to call the whole world! THE ALL is calling, The ball is rolling! Time is milling, The Soul is willing... Riddle : The next year is three times the same and yet only one.

Outwardly you may justify yourself or prove your innocence to someone else, but a mistake pricks a conscience. Do not justify yourself. Instead, feel the prick of the mistake. That very pinch will take you out of the mistake. A mistake means something that brings misery to you in the long run. So why would someone knowingly commit a mistake? While pointing out a mistake to someone, do you consider him as separate from you and go on pointing out his error or do you make him feel a part of you? When you point out a mistake to someone, does it make him more stressed, or does it create more awareness in that person? Often you do not point out someone's mistake when it is required. Not pointing out a mistake -- with due consideration to time and place -- is also a mistake. Do not lament over your mistake. Just take the lesson from it. You will not be judged by your mistakes, but by your virtues. Mistakes are of the earth. Virtues are of the Divine. Wise is the one who learns from other's mistakes. Less wise is the one who learns from his own mistakes. The fool keeps making the same mistakes again and again and never learns from them.",

Making an act without any purpose attached to it - it is freedom - like a dance. So just step out of the rational mind and you will  find a greater freedom, an unfathomable depth, and you willl come face to face with reality. Reality transcends logic and the rational mind. Until you transcend the rational mind you will not get access to creativity and the infinite. But if you do an irrational act in order to find freedom, then it already has a purpose and a meaning. It is no longer irrational. This knowledge sheet has already spoiled it's own possibility. Break the barrier of the rational mind and then find freedom for yourself.",

Here is the solution....FEEL GENEROUS....right away, not tomorrow. Either a princess or a pauper can feel generous. Generosity is the quality of the spirit. When you feel generous your life becomes abundant, full of compassion and love. Question: Is generosity the same as being grateful? Answer: No. Gratefulness always has self concern. You are grateful because you have something or you get something. Generosity is an expression independent of external circumstances. No one can make you feel generous. That is something that you have to do yourself. Essentially, generosity is not an act. It is a state of consciousness, but it cannot but find its expression in an act. Question: What about passion? Answer: Passion indicates scarcity. Dispassion is abundance. Dispassion without generosity makes you self-centered, causes more dryness. You dont´ have to think about what you have done in the past. That only brings doership. Just feel generous.",

  "text": "Krishna tells Arjuna, \"You are very dear to me.\" Then Krishna tells Arjuna he must surrender. Surrender begins with an assumption. First you must assume. You assume you are the most beloved of the Divine, and then surrender happens. Surrender is not an action; it is an assumption. Non-surrender is ignorance. Non-surrender is an illusion. So surrender is an assumption. Surrender has to begin as an assumption and then it reveals itself as a reality. Finally, it reveals itself as an illusion. An illusion because there is no two, no duality. There is no independent existence of anyone. An individual has no independent existence. That is it! Question: Do you have to go through surrender to realize it is an illusion? Answer: Yes, absolutely. Question: Where is choice then? Answer: Choice is your destiny. Krishna doesn't tell Arjuna in the beginning that he must surrender. First he says, \"You are so dear to me.\" And then he tells him, \" There is no other choice for you, you must surrender. Either you do it now, or you do it later.\" This is the path of love.",

  "text": "Only in deep rest can the Divine come, not by doing. All the doings are to help you become silent. Not enjoying the bliss or the peace takes you further - otherwise the bliss or the peace can create cravings. If the existence wants to give it, then fine. It takes courage to say \"I am\". Your true nature is bliss. But trying to enjoy the bliss, you step down from is-ness to am-ness - \"l am peaceful\", \"I am blissful\". And that is followed by \"I am miserable\". \"l am\" is dispassion. You can be anywhere and be dispassionate. Dispassion is welcoming everything. Centeredness brings energy, a spark. Enjoyment of bliss brings inertia. If you are dispassionate, the bliss is still there. When the freezer is full of ice cream you do not bother about it. Dispassion takes away the sense of scarcity. Passion is a sense of lack of abundance. And whenever everything is abundance, dispassion happens. And when dispassion is there, everything comes in abundance. Q: What do we do when we catch ourselves enjoying our bliss? Guruji: Then we feel stupid. Just an understanding we are enjoying it, creates a shift. There is no effort. Knowledge is better than action to make you free.",

When you ask for mercy, you are self- centered. You want to be excused from the law of cause and effect. It also indicates lack of courage and valor. At times mercy is an impediment to growth. Mercy, of course, brings some comfort and relief; but can impair the process of transformation. If the leaves were to ask for mercy from falling, they would not be transformed. If someone is driving and is tired, they will stop at the rest area. But if they start living there, they will be arrested (laughter). Then the spot has not served its purpose. Patti and Victoria, high on bliss, did not stop at the stop sign and the police mercilessly gave them a ticket (in India-memo). Do you know what? Victoria said, \"Thank you.\" But the police woman told her to go to court and ask for mercy! (laughter) When you know and trust the process of creation, you will simply rejoice. It is the small mind which superimposes its nature on the Divine mind. Only when you made a mistake and you think God is angry and judging you do you ever ask for mercy.

When the mind is not integrated it is feverish, disloyal and opportunistic. Disloyalty comes out of opportunism. Opportunism is short-sightedness of one's destiny. Integrity or wholeness is essential to be healthy. A divided mind will gradually lead to schizophrenia and other physical and mental disorders. Loyalty is a real strength and will have the support of nature in the long run. Fear and ambitions are impediments to loyalty. Loyalty is needed both in the material and spiritual plane. Either to destroy, create or maintain any institution, group or society, loyalty is essential. Loyalty means believing in the continuity of commitment. Honouring commitment is loyalty. It takes you beyond the duality of craving and aversion. Responsibility, dedication, commitment are the limbs of loyalty. A loyal mind is a 'yes'-mind. The purpose of asking questions is to get an answer. The purpose of all answers is to create a ...'yes'.... 'Yes' is an acknowledgement of knowledge. The 'yes'-mind is a quiet, holistic and joyful mind. The 'no'-mind is a agitated, doubting and miserable mind. Loyalty begins with a 'yes'-mind and starts to perish with a 'no'-mind.",

Is it because of their qualities or is it because of a sense of kinship or intimacy? You can love someone for their qualities and not feel a sense of kinship. This type of love gives rise to competition and jealousy. Such is not the case when love arises out of kinship. If you love someone for their qualities, then when the quality changes or you get used to the quality, love also changes. However, if you love someone out of kinship, because they belong to you, then that love remains for life-times. People say \"I love God, because He is great\". This is no big thing. If God is found to be ordinary, just one of us, then your love for God collapses! If you love God, because He is yours, then however God is, whether He creates or destroys, you still love Him. The love for kinship is like the love for yourself. Question:Many people do not have love  for themselves?Answer:No! It is the other way around. They love themselves so much, that they want better qualities and better appearance for themselves. This love of qualities makes them be hard on one self.If love is based on the quality of a person, then the love is not stable - after  sometime the qualities change and the love becomes shaky. Loving someone because  of their greatness or uniqueness is Third-rate love. Loving someone because they  belong to you, great or otherwise, is unconditional love. Knowledge, Sadhana, Seva and Satsang help to bring about a sense of belonging in no time. When love springs forth from a sense of belongingness then the actions and qualities do not over shadow the love. Neither the qualities nor actions can be perfect all the time. Love and a feeling of kinship alone can be perfect.",

  "title": "Singing, Communication and Ego",
  "text": "There are three modes of communication: in head to head communication you talk, in heart to heart communication you sing, and soul to soul communication happens in silence. When you meet with people, often you communicate from head to head. When you are with nature, you start singing, you communicate with nature from your heart. Often when you are with people you keep talking, blabbering, and you keep the communication on the level of the head only. But when you are with nature, you start humming and your communication comes through the heart. And when you are with the guru, you go blank and forget all the questions. Then communication comes through the soul in silence. When you meet with people, you like to remain in the head, you seldom sing with people (other than when it is organised). Your ego obstructs you from singing. Many do not feel comfortable singing with people. When you sing with people then you descend to the heart level or feeling level. Some feel comfortable just listening to music. Some feel comfortable singing only when they are alone. Some sing to draw attention or to charm others. Some only want to join in when all the others are singing. All this singing comes from ego. Bhajan means sharing, sharing from the deepest level of our existence. Bhajan is authentic sharing. If you could sing with people, then your ego shatters. Children can sing with people for they do not have ego. To sing with a stranger you have to be free of ego. Ego doesn't let you sing with a stranger. Head level is safe for the ego -heart level breaks the ego - soul level dissolves the ego. All communication gaps happen because of ego. Exercise: when you are with people, rather then chatting just start singing and you can feel the shift of energy that is happening. If you want to have more fun, greet a stranger with a song.",

  "title": "EXPANSION OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS PEACE",
  "text": "Consciousness moving on the surface of the body is stimuli, which cause pleasure. When consciousness shrinks, then the sensation of pain and suffering arises. Suffering is the shrinking or contraction of consciousness. When consciousness moves through the body in limited channels, pleasure is experienced. Repeated enjoyment of the stimuli causes inertia and dullness. Often cooks don't enjoy their own food. Listening to the same piece of music loses the charm, people in the sex industry don't enjoy sex. If the stimuli are observed, then consciousness expands and becomes peace. With awareness the stimuli lose their significance; whether they exist or not makes no difference. When the sun is there, then whether the candle is lit or not makes no difference. To realise that all pleasures are just stimuli and that you are more than the stimuli brings freedom. Pain is nothing but consciousness wanting to expand and to become free. Freedom basically is liberation from the craving of the stimuli. Pain is not a permanent state. The natural tendency of consciousness is to expand, to become bliss. Like the natural tendency of water is to flow downward, and the natural tendency of air is not to be under pressure, the natural tendency of consciousness is to expand and to be at peace. Like the person who is an insomniac and has forgotten how to sleep, most of us have forgotten to be at peace and in bliss.",

  "text": "The body is dependent on the whole creation. In society, somebody has to make clothes, produce electricity, drill for oil. The body cannot be independent of the world. For the body, dependency is absolute. When the Spirit identifies with the body, then it gets pinched and looks for independence. Mind, intellect, ego - they all look for independence. In looking for independence often you get stuck in the ego and become more miserable. Most people are not aware of their dependency. When they become aware of their limitations and dependency, the desire for independence arises. Independence cannot be achieved unless you start moving from within. When you move within, you discover that you are interdependent. Individual Self/Soul/Jeeva is interdependence and in fact every wise person knows that everything is interdependent and that there is nothing like independence. On one level dependency is a harsh reality. On another level, it is an illusion because there is nothing else but the Self. It's only when you don't feel oneness, belongingness that you want independence. The Self being non-dual, there is no question of dependence or independence. One who asks for independence is a beggar. One who knows that it is an illusion is a King. When the sense of belongingness is not well founded, then there is a volatile state in the life of a seeker. Then the ego finds some excuse to revert to smallness. It is not yet totally soaked in the totality of knowledge. As it is not used to it, the mind finds every little excuse to revert back to the ego and to be aloof and independent and separate and it would find any small fault and blow it out of proportion. Be aware of these tendencies and come what may, be strong in the commitment to the Satsang, the Path.",

Lust is nothing but primordial un-harnessed energy. The same when harnessed manifests as enthusiasm, sparkle, sharpness of intellect and love. What are the factors which can sublimate or transform lust into love?",

  "text": "You can be at ease with the uncertainty of the world when you realise the certainty of the consciousness. Often people do just the opposite. They are certain about the things in the world and uncertain about God. They rely on something that is not reliable and get upset. Uncertainty causes craving for stability and the most stable thing in the universe is our Self. The world is of change, the Self is of non-change. You have to rely on the non-change and accept the change. If you are certain that everything is uncertain, then you are liberated. When you are uncertain in ignorance then you become worried and tense. Uncertainty with awareness brings higher states of consciousness and a smile. Bharat says: A certain smile!!! Often people think that certainty is freedom. If you feel that freedom when you are not certain then that is 'real' freedom. Often your certainty or uncertainty is based on the relative world. To be certain about the uncertainty of the relative, makes you certain about the existence of the absolute and brings a 'certain' faith in the absolute. Nitin says: Yes, to understand this you certainly need to have awareness!!!",

The whole world is nothing but organization, where the atoms have decided to organize themselves in a specific pattern to form a particular substance. And those particular patterns bring them specific qualities. Death/decay/transformation happens when the atoms get bored of patterns and decide to recognise themselves. e.g. : When the atoms of the apple say \"Enough of being an apple\", that's when the rotting starts. If there is never boredom of patterns, there can be no decay. The movement from one organized state to another is also organized. This is the transient organization which we call chaos. This transient organization may need a catalyst. Knowledge is such a catalyst. So, you have absolutely no escape from organisation.",

Recycling brings back purity and hygiene. Knowledge recycles the mind. Knowledge keeps everything fresh. That is why you can keep recycling the same creation. A mind in Knowledge finds everything fresh. If you dont put Knowledge to the mind, the mind gets rotten. Knowledge brings the mind back to purity. Recycling brings purity and hygiene. Hygiene supports health, and too much hygiene destroys health. In a too hygienic situation the immune system in the body becomes like lazy, unequipped soldiers. People who live in slums often dont get sick, because their immune system becomes like a well-trained soldier. Often people who are too fussy about hygiene have poor health. Sometimes unhygienic conditions create health. It keeps your immune system active, alive and strong, while Knowledge keeps your mind fresh.",

  "text": "Bliss cannot be understood. It is extremely difficult to get into bliss. After many lifetimes you get into bliss. It is even more difficult to get out of bliss.  All that you seek in your life is bliss, that divine union with your source, and everything else in the world distracts you from that goal.  There are a zillion things to distract you from that goal in so many ways.  So many unexplainable, incomprehensible ways of not coming home. The mind is kept alive by cravings and aversions - shoulds or should nots and wants.  Only when the mind dies does the bliss dawn.  Bliss is the abode of all divinity, all devas.  It is possible only in this human body to comprehend, to uphold, and having had a human life and having known this path, if you still do not realize this - you are at the greatest loss.  The cravings and aversions make your heart hard.  There is no use in being polite in your behavior. You can be rude in your behavior but you cannot be rough in your heart.  If you are rude in your behavior, it is acceptable, but not if you are rough in your heart.  The world does not care how you are inside.  It only looks to your behavior.  The Divine does not care how you are outside – It only looks to your inside.  Never let any tiny bit of dislike or craving house in your heart.  Let it be fresh, soft and fragrant like a rose. It is such an illusion – you dislike someone or something, and this only makes you hard and your hardness takes a long time to soften, to disappear.  It is such a trap for keeping you away from the treasure.  Nothing in this material world can give you contentment.  An outer-looking mind seeking for contentment gets discontented and the discontentment grows, and complaints and negativity start hardening the brain, clouding the awareness (the aura), and forming a huge cloud of negative energy.  When the negativity reaches its peak, like an overloaded balloon, it bursts and comes back to the Divinity.  You can never escape the Divine, the long route of negativity, or the instantaneous positive approach.  When the Divinity dawns, in no time the shift happens from the untruth to truth, from darkness to light, from the dull inert matter to the sparkling spirit.  When the heart is hard, there is no fun.  You cannot experience fun.",

Your body resists something and welcomes something. Where the resistance is weak, the persistence happens.  A weak resistance makes the opposition persist.  A strong resistance erases the opposition.  Strong resistance leads to valour, power and samadhi (equanimity).  It brings in you the strength of a warrior.

Usually we get stuck in our differences, because we have lost sight of ourselves. In the name of love we try to manipulate and control the other person. This is natural that when we love somebody, we want them to be perfect. You can never see the pits in the ground from the top of a hill. From a plane the earth looks so smooth. So also from a state of elevated consciousness, you do not see the pitfalls in others. But if you come to the ground you always see the holes. And when you want to fill the holes, you have to see them. You cannot build a home being airborne. You cannot till the land without looking at the pits, filling them, removing the pebbles.... That is why when you love somebody you find all the faults in them. But finding faults destroys love. Instead of filling the pits we run away from them.

Here are some salient attributes of love and lust. They are so different yet so close! If you find more you may add to the list. If someone's lust is interrupted they get angry and start hating. Hatred in the world today is not out of love, it is out of lust. Love is playfulness and in lust there is cunningness and manipulation. Shiva, the embodiment of innocence and love was meditating. His meditation was disturbed by an arrow of flowers from the lord of lust. As soon as Shiva woke up he opened his third eye and the lord of lust, Manmatha (one who churns the mind) was reduced to ashes. Everybody celebrated by throwing colors on each other realising that life is full of colours. We play many roles in our life.

The message of non-violence has to come loud and clear so that it can be heard from a young age. A sense of shame has to be connected with anger and violence. The reason for violence in young people is a sense of pride in anger and violence, not a sense of shame. People feel proud that they are violent or angry. They think it is prestigious or a status symbol to be aggressive. Aggression is not thought to be a quality to be ashamed of. This promotes aggression and violence in the whole society, and when aggression and violence are promoted, human values diminish. Some movies and modern music glorify frustration, anger and revenge and make these a role model for children. We need to promote human values especially love compassion and belongingness loud and clear.

A thing to know is an object of knowing.  You have made it into an object of knowing.  Whatever you have faith in, you do not need to know about it.  Do not make that something you have faith in, an object of knowing.  Like you have faith in God, you cannot make God an object of knowing; like you have faith in yourself, you can't make the Self an object of knowing.Q. Are faith and belief the same?Guruji: Belief is a little diluted, faith is little strong, more concrete.Our beliefs can change, faith is firm.  Faith is yogurt, belief is buttermilk. (Laughter....) Like a child has faith in the mother, the child does not make the mother into an object of knowing.  The child does not try to know the mother, it simply has faith in the mother.  When you have faith, what is the need to know it?  You cannot make love an object of knowing, if you try to make love an object of knowing, if you try to know it, it will disappear.In the same way you cannot make Self, or God an object of knowing.  God, love, sleep, and Self are beyond knowing.  If you try to analyze, doubt comes in and faith will disappear.  So whatever you want to have faith in, do not want to know it or analyze it.  The moment you make something an object of knowing then analysis starts and then doubt follows.  Analysis creates a distance, synthesis brings it together.  Faith is synthesis, knowing is analysis.Barbara: Can you have faith without being aware of it?Guruji: Yes. You have faith.  Consciousness cannot exist without faith.  Faith is a relaxed, stable, quality of consciousness.  It is like the flame of a candle.  The nature of consciousness is faith.Theologians analyze too much.  They study 5 to 6 years and then they lose their faith. A story: Jyoti once met an officer in-charge of religious affairs.  The minister was so sure that no one can have spiritual experiences.  She gave him a short talk on spirituality and she concluded by saying,  \"I believe in what I experience.\"  His comment was, \"I am glad to hear that you too are anatheist!\"  Another ANALYSIS by a theologian has recently concluded that Jesus never existed.Nick: Does God have faith in us?Guruji: I don't know?!!

Success indicates non-supremacy. Success means what?  It indicates that there are chances of failure.  If something is supreme there is nothing to lose.  People running after success only exhibit their limitations. Success means crossing a limit.  To cross a limit you need to assume that you have a limit.  Assuming a limit is underestimating yourself.  If you have no boundaries then where is your success?  If you have limitless access then there is no success.  You don't say that you successfully drank a glass of water, because it is well within your capabilities.  But when you do something that is beyond your perceived limits you claim success. When you realise your unboundedness then no action is an achievement. Anyone who claims to be successful only reveals his limitation.  If you feel very successful it means that you have underestimated yourself.  All your gains can only be smaller than you.  Taking pride in any gains is belittling yourself.

When religion and politics don't coexist then you have corrupt politicians and pseudo-religious leaders. A religious man who is righteous and loving will definitely care for the welfare of the whole population and hence becomes a true politician. And a true politician can only be righteous and loving. He cannot be anything but religious. All the Avatars and prophets have been caring for people and so were in politics. You can find many examples to this effect. When religions restrict the freedom to worship and restrict modes of worship they become unsuitable for creating a harmonious society. When religion becomes all encompassing and gives full freedom to pray and worship in any manner -- that religion will bring righteousness and peace in people and will be suitable for any society. People think politics and religion have to be kept separate because many religions did not give freedom to worship and did not care for all people equally. History has shown that religion has created conflict. But irreligious societies (e.g. communism) have created chaos and corruption. Today both religion and politics need reform. Religion has to become broader and more spiritual to allow freedom of worship and broader to encompass all the wisdom in the world. And politicians have to become more righteous and spiritual.",

  "title": "LOVE AND RENUNCIATION",
  "text": "Only one who has renounced can truly love.  To the degree you have renounced, to that degree you have the ability to love. Often people think those who renounce cannot love, and those who love cannot renounce.  This is because so-called renunciants do not seem to be in love, and so-called lovers are very possessive and are in need. True love is non-possessive and brings freedom, and renunciation is nothing but freedom.  Only in freedom can love fully blossom.  When in love you say, \"I want nothing, I just want this.\"  Renunciation is, \" I don't want anything.  I am free.\"  In love there is no other need. Renunciation is having no need.  Love and renunciation, although appearing to be opposites, are two sides of the same coin. McQueen said -- They are the same side of the same coin. (laughter) Tara asked -- Does this mean the lover renounces his beloved? Guruji responded -- You renounce the attachment, the possessiveness.  Renunciation doesn't diminish love; it enhances it. Only renunciation can sustain love and joy.  Without renunciation love turns into misery, possessiveness, jealousy and anger. Renunciation brings contentment and contentment sustains love.  Without renunciation one gets discontented, frustrated, sad, fearful, suspicious, analytical.  And the whole soap opera begins.  And this is what we find in society , don't we? The so-called renunciants have run away from life frustrated and disappointed.  Real renunciation is born out of knowledge and wisdom, knowledge of life in the background of time and space and in the context of this magnanimous universe.",

The mother has total love for the child, but sometimes she feeds the child, sometimes she is strict with the child. \"Come on, sit and write!\" Sometimes she slaps the child. She does this out of love, and these are all different modes of love. So the expression of love changes. But love itself does not change, because love is your nature.",

At the deepest level, thanking has no meaning. Does one hand thank the other hand? The deeper you go, you see there is no \"other\" to be thanked. Feeling is also superficial.

To overcome aversion, hatred, jealousy, attraction or entanglements, you have to go to the atom. Going to the atom means accepting a teeny tiny bit of all this. It may be difficult to accept something that you don't like but you can definitely accept a teeny tiny bit (an atom) of it. The moment you accept that one atom, you will see change happen. This has to be done in a meditative state. Suppose you love someone. You want more and more of them. Yet there is no fulfilment. In Anu Vrat (the vow of an atom), you take just one atom of that person and that is enough to bring fulfilment to you. Though the river is vast, a little sip quenches your thirst. Though Earth has so much food, just a little bite satisfies your hunger. All that you need is teeny tiny bits. Accept a teeny tiny bit of everything in life, that will bring you fulfilment. Stephano: What about trouble? There is so much trouble in the world, you can accept just a teeny tiny part of it. Tonight go to bed feeling that you are satisfied, taking a teeny tiny part of divinity with you. Satisfaction comes from the subtle and not from the \"more and more\". Question: What about giving?

At the same time, are the judges cruel to the offenders? No; the judges' compassion is for the non-availability of knowledge, not for the suffering of the criminals. It is their karma. Often people think compassion is an act, an action. Know that compassion is your very nature. Then you will see that karma and compassion are not contradictory but complement each other.

For those present around GURUJI, it was an amazing experience to feel the depth of love and not an iota of grief ! It was a celebration of knowledge, never before experienced! Even as the news came, Guruji kept meeting people and addressed the big Satsang with the same smile as always. All her life AMMA served with love, humour and dynamism, extending her motherly love to one and all. She had an unparalleled love for GURUJI and shared a unique relationship with HIM - not only as a son but also as a Mentor. Hundreds of people bid a moving farewell to AMMA, singing JAI JAI RADHA RAMAN. AMMA'S mortal ashes were brought to Delhi and GURUJI accompanied them to HARDWAR and immersed them in the Holy Ganges there. A portion of her ashes were also immersed in the river Cauvery, on whose banks AMMA grew up. On the 9th of Nov., itself, GURUJI was the chief guest at the consecration of the VISHALAKSHI temple at Varanasi, an invitation that had come two months ago. At this very temple, GURUJI'S grandfather had prayed 70 years ago and was blessed with AMMA. Creation returned to it's source as GURUJI reinstalled the very same ancient deity from whom AMMA got her name, on the very same day that she left for her Heavenly abode. The Art of Living family is greatly indebted to AMMA and seek her blessings. The Memorial Service will be on the 21st of November and all Chapters are requested to have Satsangs that day. Through this event the Art of Living has shown to the world that not only Life, but Death also can be a celebration ! An example inspires and brings confidence in the application of Knowledge. And the visible sign of it is an undying smile. The Self knows neither sorrow nor death. Yet, in it, flow all the relative events. It's easy to be detached when you are not in love. Being in utter love, and yet undisturbed; caring yet not worried; persistent yet not perturbed, are all the obvious signs of the Self shining through !",

Science, though appearing to resolve the mystery in creation, has deepened it. The knowledge of particles, wave functions, black holes, the vacuum state, etc have only deepened the mystery. 5.  Mantrarahasya (secret of mantras) The mantras and their effect, influence, method and mode of working are all a mystery.

(Laughter) Guruji says: When you have a problem and you think it cannot be solved, then you have accepted it then it is no longer a problem; it is a fact. For example: Suppose you think it is a problem that the ocean in Norway is too cold. Obviously, you cannot heat the ocean. If it cannot be solved, you accept it and it's no longer a problem. Only when you are searching for a solution is there a problem and so there is no problem that cannot be solved. (Laughter) The moment you realize there is no solution, a problem ceases to be a problem. The solution is the tail of every problem. Solutions come to you when :You are calm and collectedYou use intelligenceYou are not lethargic but activeYou have strong faith in Divine law Kai says: If you don't want any problems, you can have a Guru. Sheila says: If you want all the problems of all the people, become a Guru. Tom says: Focusing on the problem alone, you cannot solve it.

  "title": "FEEL THE PINCH",
  "text": "A devotee asked Guruji: Please forgive me if I have committed a mistake. Sri Sri: Why should you be forgiven? You are asking for forgiveness because you feel a pinch and you want to be free from it, isn't it? Let the pinch be there. The pinch will not let the mistake happen again. Forgiveness removes the pinch and you keep repeating the mistake! Question: How do you know a mistake is a mistake? Sri Sri: A mistake is something that gives you a pinch. If it hasn't pinched you, it is not a mistake at all. It is the pinch that irks the consciousness and that pinch disallows the mistake to be repeated. Be with the pinch and not the guilt. It is a very fine balance. Question: What is the difference between guilt and pinch? Sri Sri: Guilt is about a specific action and pinch is about a specific result or happening. You can only feel guilty about what you did and not about what happened. But whatever happened, whether because of you or someone else can cause a pinch in you. Question: How do we get over the guilt? Tom Gill: Just blame the boss!!! ( laughter) Sri Sri: Through wisdom, by knowing the nature of mind, nature of consciousness and from a broader perspective of the phenomenon, you can get over the guilt. Question: Cant we learn from our mistakes without feeling the pinch? Sri Sri: Learning is at an intellectual level whereas you feel the pinch at an emotional level. The drive of your emotions is much stronger than your intellect. So a pinch will not let the mistake recur. Bharat: We feel guilt where we have control, it is at the intellectual level, whereas a pinch is at the emotional level where we do not have control. Question: So, should we discard the intellect? Sri Sri: You cannot be driven by your emotions alone. Your intellect acts like a brake for your emotions! Feel the pinch. The pinch will create an awareness that what happened was beyond your capacity. The awareness will bring you to surrender. Surrender will free you from guilt. So, from pinch to awareness to surrender to freedom are the steps of evolution.",

  "text": "Often, when you praise, you praise in comparison to someone else.  In order to praise one person, we put down someone else and when we want to point out somebody's mistake we praise another. Some are stingy in praising, and some are shy. And some others are simply not used to. Some praise with motives, and some others just to elevate. Others praise themselves in order to hide their low self-esteem. The real praise dawns in a blossomed state of consciousness. The praise that comes out of an elevated state of consciousness is simply its nature and is quite different.  Normally praise comes out of craving and pride. The praise from a heightened consciousness is always out of fulfilment. Praising can no doubt elevate the consciousness and bring enthusiasm and energy.  At the same time it can also bring arrogance.  Praising is a skill. When someone praises you, do you take it without shying away? Accepting praise without shyness, is also a skill.",

  "title": "NEWS FLOOD",
  "text": "This week we had so much newsthat we are sending just the news flood! It has been an unusually hectic week even by Sri Sri's standards.  Last Friday, Sri Sri addressed three satsangs in a single day, starting with the rural satsang among thousands of poor people of Inchilla, a brief stopover with the enthusiastic devotees of Belgaum, and on to the urban elite of Goa, with the sound of our bhajans reverberating everywhere. Ahmedabad was all keyed up as Sri Sri returned after a two-year gap.Teachers from all over Gujarat had been working together to make this the biggest satsang ever.  In the morning, over 25, 000 people did the Sudarshan Kriya conducted \"live\" by Sri Sri...Intense experiences, strong fragrances, changes in the weather pattern were happening as three eagles circled directly overhead, joined by a flock of other birds Ö a cosmic rhythm was set in motion. Many people shared that their entire life was one side and this event on the other, such was the magnitude of the experience for them.  Kriya was followed by an elaborate lunch for the participants the network of volunteers had organised 60 counters to feed all of them! In the evening, the same cricket stadium was transformed, with a huge lotus designed up in the stands for Guruji to sit in, and video screens all over the grounds. It was a sight to see streams of people flooding in, all excited and happy even before the program began, the crowd totalled nearly 200,000!  The traffic diversion for the event was announced by the traffic police well in advance, as THE event took off without any chaos. Following 27 minutes of total, still meditation, the entire crowd were on their feet, singing and dancing Ö the sub-inspector of police remarked that even though a meagre force of 500 was deployed, they had nothing to do, so blissful and orderly was the crowd. The policemen would hug people, and confessed that only their uniform was preventing them from joining the dance. The high priests of the ancient city of Dwarka (Krishna's capital), came all the way to invite Guruji, and placed a resplendent turban (which was from the temple deity) on His head. The next day was the foundation-laying ceremony of the Gujarat ashram on the banks of the river Mahi.  After a brief satsang in Vidyanagar, Guruji addressed over 3,000 Art Excel kids Ö it was the best ever question-and-answer session, with witty one-line exchanges between the little ones and the Wise One. Enthusiastic devotees with a live band awaited Guruji at 4 am in Jamnagar.  Guruji visited the ancient capital of Krishna in Dwarka for a Vishnu Yagna in the ancient Dwarkadheesh Temple. The entire city danced as Guruji was taken in a horse-drawn carriage through the streets of Dwarka's  it was a non-stop celebration. That evening, we had another Divine Satsang in Jamnagar, before returning to Ahmedabad. The blissful ones are now in Delhi, en route to Rishikesh. PS: The three-year-old daughter of one of our devotees fell from a three-story building recently.  She told her parents later that \"That bearded uncle whose photo we have at home He caught me!\" She escaped totally unhurt.  (Caution: Please don't try this at home!!) SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: Dear Ones, Some days ago I posted this on the Satsang email but am not  sure the attachment could be opened so here it is as just a plain old email.  This effort can be coordinated so that politicians can be contacted by one person acting for each Satsang group.  You can contact these folks through the WWW at:  http://government.aol.com/mygov/  or  http://www.senate.gov/  or  http://www.house.gov/ Love and Peace, Dean THIS COMES FROM INDIA: The Times of India on February 10th came with this article and another about President Clinton's visit to India in March 2000.  In light of the increased awareness of the government of the United States we think that now is the time to awaken all sectors of society to The Art of Living and the projects we are doing around the world, especially our 5H program and our schools in Bangalore, Assam and Bengal.  We would like committees to be formed from Satsang groups to actively participate in contacting their respective Senators and Representatives in each state as soon as possible to convey the vision of the organization and request for full national participation in our service projects in the rural areas of India.  The 5H program involves improvement of the quality of life by addressing Home, Health, Hygiene, Human Values and Harmony in Diversity. For more details about our programs please contact Ajay Tejasvi at ajay_tejasvi@vsnl.com or Dean & Shirley Harmison at Ahimsa108@aol.com.",

Discarding the form, you become a lost ascetic, a space cadet or an emotional junk! B: Aggression and Intuition Aggression and assertiveness overshadow intuition. Often, people who are sensitive tend to become aggressive in order to avoid being hurt. In this process, they lose sight of the fine intuition. Fine intuition needs sensitivity; sensitivity is often painful. In order to avoid pain one becomes aggressive and assertive, and in turn loses one's intuitive ability. Intuition is close to the truth. To be truthful, you don't need to be aggressive and assertive! Often, aggression and assertiveness thrive on the idea of truthfulness.",

Dispassion: Know the whole thing will be over one way or the other, and it doesn't matter. Meditation and breathing can calm you down.  Drop whatever you are doing and do something completely irrelevant, e.g. while decorating your house, take a moment off to cut grass, or go shopping!  When you are doing something very important, take a moment off to do something totally irrelevant and insignificant. This enhances your creativity.  Relevant action keeps you bound to the action.

The destiny or a happening in which you have a part to play may trigger a desire of which you have no idea.

Dasharatha (In Sanskrit this means \"the ten charioted one\") signifies the five organs of sense and the five organs of action.  Kaushalya (Sanskrit for \"skilled\") stands for skill. The skillful reiner of the ten chariots can give birth to Ram.  When the ten are used skillfully, radiance is born within. Rama was born in Ayodhya (Sanskrit for \"the place where no war can happen\"). When there is no conflict in our mind, then the radiance can dawn. Lakshmana, the brother of Rama, was born of Sumitra Ö the good friend.  When the ten are cooperating with you then Awareness is born. Often we try to look for radiance within.  Just realize that you are radiant.  Once when Guruji was 5 or 6 years old, he closed his eyes and asked a visiting saint, \"Swamiji, I do not see any light\".  The saint replied, \"You are the light!  How can you see the light?\"",

Otherwise your thankfulness is centered around ego. You are grateful, but not for an act. You are grateful for what is. As every individual is nothing but a puppet of the ONE, thanking and being obliged is simply an exhibition of ignorance.  Everything is ruled, controlled and managed by one Divinity, that consciousness has to shine forth in every act of yours; you do not have to make a mood of it.

Your need to be appeased by someone else is the sign of grossness. This is the root of ignorance. If you want attention, all you get is tension. Become one whose enthusiasm never dies, come what may.

When you think that others are responsible, then your degree of responsibility diminishes. When you are in total Vairagya (dispassion), you can take care of even trivial and insignificant things with such perfection. For example, during the Pooja every morning, Guruji decorates the Pooja table with flowers with such great care, choosing different color combinations and patterns everyday; fully knowing that the decoration is not going to last even 10 minutes. After the Pooja He himself would remove the garlands from the Pooja table or shower people with the flowers on it. Yet even while He is in a deep state of Samadhi, He would effortlessly and lovingly decorate the Pooja table everyday. It is obvious that it does not matter how the flowers are kept, but still attention to even such a trivial thing with such keenness of awareness can only come through utter dispassion.

It was this day that the demon Narakasaura was killed. King Narakasura (Naraka means hell) had been granted a boon that he could be destroyed only by a woman. Lord KrishnaÒ³ wife Satyabhama was the one to destroy him. Why only Satyabhama could kill Naraka? Satya means truth and bhama means the beloved. Untruth or lack of love cannot conquer hell.  It cannot be removed by aggression. Hell can only be erased by love and surrender. Non-aggression, love and surrender are the inherent qualities of a woman. Hence only Satyabhama, the true beloved could remove hell and bring the light back. And NarakasuraÒ³ last wish was that every house should celebrate his exit with lights to mark the end of darkness. This is Deepawali. Also it was today that Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya, his Kingdom, after his victory over Ravana, the demon king. Ayodhya means that which cannot be destroyed, i.e. life.

How can an instrument be confused, and how can an instrument be clear! This state is called Nimit - just being an instrument of the Divine. Being very clear means not opening to new possibilities and can lead to limitations. Unlimited possibilities are open to one who is not clear and not confused. Your mind swings from clarity to confusion and confusion to clarity but the state in which there is no doership nor inertia is the most creative and progressive state. Sharmila: Will this not lead to lethargy? Sri Sri: No. A sharp instrument does its job perfectly, effortlessly. Sharmila: What about focus? Sri Sri: Focus is natural to a dynamic consciousness. Confusion arises when new information flows in and clarity is lost. Then confusion again seeks clarity. Clarity constricts the possibility of new information. A confused consciousness seeks clarity and every confusion is breaking away from clarity. If there is only confusion, there is frustration. If there is only clarity, there is rigidity. After giving contradictory knowledge, Krishna tells Arjuna, \"Just be Nimit!\" And to be an instrument, the prerequisite is to be madly in love! That's why in love there is neither confusion nor clarity; or there is both - confusion and clarity! Nazreen: Is truth more important than love? Sri Sri: I'm confused! Is it clear? (laughter)",

  "title": "SACREDNESS AND YOU",
  "text": "Throughout the ages, in all cultures, place, time, persons and symbols were all considered sacred. Whenever you consider a symbol, place, time, person or act sacred, your attention is undivided and whole. When things are ordinary and same, you tend to slip into unawareness and inertia. The moment you consider something sacred, your inertia disappears and you become more alive. There is nothing as fulfilling as a sacred act. You put your heart and soul in a sacred act. When every action of yours becomes sacred, you have become one with the Divine. Then every minute of your life is sacred, every place you go to becomes sacred, every person you meet is only your reflection, and every act of yours is sacred. Question: Why does an act when performed repeatedly lose it sacredness? Sri Sri: This happens when your memory overpowers your consciousness and you lose your sensitivity. For example, people living in Benares do not feel that it is a sacred place. That sensitivity is just not there. Question: How can we preserve that feeling of sacredness in our acts? Sri Sri: Through living in the present moment and through Sadhana. Your Sadhana will not allow your memory to overpower consciousness. Repetition is not a hindrance then. The Native American Indians and the tribals consider the earth, sun, moon and all the directions as sacred. In the ancient tradition, the Rishis considered all the rivers, mountains and even animals, trees and herbs as sacred. What to say of people? They are definitely sacred! In different parts of the world, certain symbols, certain places and different times of the year are considered sacred. Various cultures honor certain people and consider them as sacred. For example, Christians consider the Cross, Jerusalem, Christmas and the Pope as sacred. For Muslims, the Crescent Moon, Mecca and the month of Ramadan are sacred. The Hindus consider the river Ganges, the Himalayas and the Swamis as sacred. It is good to begin feeling that some symbols, places, time and people are sacred so that you can be awake and alive. But eventually you need to transcend and feel that the entire creation and your whole life is sacred. For the man of God, the whole world, with all its symbols, places and people are sacred at all times. BE A MAN OF GOD!",

You start experiencing your own form and discover that you are indeed formless, hollow and empty. And this abstract non-form in you becomes more and more concrete!!! The guru makes the abstract more real and what you thought as solid appears to be more unreal. Sensitivity and subtlety dawns. Perception of love, not as an emotion, but as the substratum of existence becomes evident. The formless spirit shines through every form in creation and mystery of life deepens, shattering the atheism. Then the journey begins and it has four stages. The first stage is Saarupya (to see the formless in the form) Ö Seeing God in all the forms. Often, one feels more comfortable to see God as formless rather than with a form, because with a form, one feels a distance, a duality, a fear of rejection and other limitations. In life all of our interactions are with the form, other than in deep sleep and in Samadhi. And, if you do not see God in the form, then the waking part of life remains devoid of the Divine. All those who accept God to be formless use symbols, and perhaps love the symbols more than God himself! If God comes and tells a Christian to leave the cross or a Muslim to drop the crescent, perhaps he may not do it! To begin with loving the formless is possible only through forms. The second stage is Saamipya (closeness) Ö feeling absolutely close to the form you have chosen and reaching out to the formless. This leads to a sense of intimacy with the whole creation. In this stage, one overcomes the fear of rejection and other fears. But this is time and space bound. The third stage is Saanidhya - feeling the presence of the Divine by which you transcend the limitations of time and space. Then the final stage Ö Saayujya Ö is when you are firmly entrenched with the Divine. It is then you realize you are one with the Divine. There is a total merging with the Beloved and all duality disappears. THIS IS THAT AND THAT IS THIS. Vinod Mathur: Does a believer also go through these four stages?

  "text": "\"IMPORTANT\" AND \"UNIMPORTANT\" So many people are stuck with what is \"important\". Why do you always have to do only that which is important? Most people are caught up thinking about what is important. For something to be important, there need to be many things that are unimportant. So you cannot eliminate unimportant things. It is important to have unimportant things to make something else important. (Laughter.) Things are either themselves important or they make other things important. So that means everything is important, and. everything is unimportant. When you realize this fact you become choiceless. When you say something is important you are limiting your vastness. A journalist asked me, \"Why is it important to breathe?\" \"Why is it important to be happy?\" \"Why is it important to have peace?\" These questions are not relevant at all. Why should you always look for what is important? Something that is unimportant can contribute to something that is important. And what is important and unimportant changes with time and space. Food is important when you are hungry and unimportant when you are full. When something is inevitable you don't categorize it as important or unimportant. It is beyond choice. \"Everything is important\" is karma yoga. \"Nothing is important\" is deep meditation.",

  "title": "WORSHIP A SIGN OF MATURITY",
  "text": "For a flame to go up, you need space above. In the same way, for a man to rise up in his life, he needs an ideal, he needs something to adore and worship. Worship is the culmination of love and appreciation. Worship prevents love from turning into hatred or jealousy, and appreciation into low self-esteem. In life, if you do not adore or appreciate anything, you will be filled with negativity. And a person who has nothing to worship or adore is sure to fall into depression. Lack of adoration has led to many emotional, psychological and social problems in the society. If you have nothing to hold up high in life, selfishness, arrogance and violence are sure to follow. Adoring and honoring each other in society eliminates stress and fosters compassion and love. In the previous century, it was thought that worshipping was an uncivilized and unintelligent thing to do. Worship was thought to rise from a slavish mentality. In fact it is just the contrary. Worship can only happen through gratefulness and not through slavish mentality. In worship, a sense of belongingness, love, honor and respect all come together. Without a sense of belongingness, worship or idealism can bring low self-esteem. The ancient people knew this so they insisted that people should feel part of what they worship. They encouraged people to worship the sun, moon, mountains, rivers, plants, animals and people. WORSHIP IN A TRUE SENSE IS A SIGN OF MATURITY AND NOT WEAKNESS. Question: You said worship is the culmination of love. Does worship also have a culmination? Answer: Culmination of worship is Self knowledge, Samadhi.",

  "title": "THE KUMBHA MELA",
  "text": "Once every 12 years, all the seers, saints and aspirants of spiritual knowledge congregate at the confluence (sangam), of the 3 holy rivers, Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati. The Ganga is a symbol of Knowledge and Self-inquiry. It is on the banks of the Yamuna that events of love have been immortalized. When Knowledge and Love come together, when the head meets the heart, Saraswati, symbolic of wisdom and the fine arts emerge. When a tiny atom explodes, the radiation lasts for a long time ... the mind is even more subtle than one millionth of an atom. When the mind explodes, that is Enlightenment. Over the centuries, thousands of sages who have meditated, done penance and been enlightened come to the \"Kumbha Mela\" and relieve themselves of the burden of the merits gained through Sadhana by bathing in the rivers. Water has the quality to absorb the energy that they radiate. The seekers, who come from all corners to be in the company of the seers and saints, gain that merit when they take a dip in the rivers. Space by itself cannot be bought, and a lump of clay has no value, but when space is enveloped by clay it gains value, this is a Kumbha (pot). Spirit is all over in Nature, but when it dawns in the human body as an elevated state of consciousness, then it gains immense value. An Embodied and elevated spirit is usually referred to as Kumbha. This is why the enlightened age is also called the Aquarian age. Kumbha denotes a pot, which is symbolic of fullness and perfection. The Kumbha Mela is an ancient version of a spiritual expo.",

You come under obligation 2. You lose your freedom 3. You can't have a free and fair perception. Your thoughts and actions may not be impartial 4. Your focus, commitment, creativity and above all your time will be wasted 5  You will pick up bad habits and negative moods easily It takes a lot of wisdom to be free from the burden of obligation and not be influenced by your friends' opinions and feelings. In many occasions, it is better to be unfriendly than be friendly. Being unfriendly does not mean being aggressive and inimical. The best secretaries, personal assistants, security personnel, and judges have to be unfriendly. Those who are aloof and indifferent get centered more quickly than those who are too friendly. A certain degree of aloofness in every relationship will strengthen your personality and connect you to your source. Vinod Sethi: It's very easy to be very aloof or very friendly.

Don't try to find a shortcut to overcome longing. Don't make the longing short - that's why it's called loooonging. (Laughter) True longing in itself brings up spurts of bliss. That's why in ancient days longing was kept alive by singing and listening to kathas (stories). When longing transcends relationships, judgments, jealousy and all other negative feelings drop off. It is only with wisdom and self-knowledge that you can transcend relationships. People often think wisdom is devoid of longing - No! Such wisdom is dry. The longing that comes in true wisdom makes life juicier. Divine is certainly juicy! Longing gives you the power to bless. Bless the entire creation. For, the longing in you is God.",

It is only in spirituality that passion and dispassion can happen together.  This is the rarest combination. When you are dispassionate, you have strength, and strength is self-reliance.  True self-reliance is realizing that nothing is excluded from the Self.  And when you realize everything is part of the Self, then you can be passionate about everything!  Even to fulfill your passion, you can only rely on the Self, for Self alone is non-changing. In Truth, there is neither reliance nor passion.

  "text": "THE OTHER SIDE OF FEAR The Usefulness of Fear Nature has put an amount of inbuilt fear in all living beings. This fear makes life defend itself, protect itself. Like salt in the food, a little bit of fear is essential for people to be righteous. Fear of hurting someone makes you more conscious. Fear of failure makes you more keen and dynamic. Fear moves you from carelessness to taking care. Fear moves you from being insensitive to being sensitive. Fear moves you from dullness to alertness. Total lack of fear may lead to destructive tendencies - a distorted ego knows no fear. Neither does the expanded consciousness! Whereas the ego dismisses the fear and moves in a disruptive manner, the wise one acknowledges the fear and takes refuge in the Divine. When you are in love, when you are surrendered, there is no fear. Ego, too, knows no fear. But there is a difference, like that of heaven and earth, between these two types of fearless states. Fear makes you righteous; fear brings you close to surrender; fear keeps you on the path; keeps you from being destructive. Peace and law are maintained on the planet because of fear. A new-born child knows no fear - it totally relies on its mother. Whether a child, a kitten or a bird, when they start becoming independent they experience fear which makes them go running back to their mothers.  This is inbuilt by nature to sustain life. So, the purpose of fear is to bring you back to the source!!",

  "title": "THE PARADOX OF SACRIFICE",
  "text": "All the scriptures of the world glorify sacrifice. What is sacrifice? It is giving up something that you value. You can only sacrifice that which you would like to keep for yourself; in other words, that which gives you pleasure and joy. You cannot sacrifice something that you dislike or disown. Sacrifice is always related to a higher cause for a greater good. At the same time, when your love for the greater good is so strong, nothing else assumes any value. Sacrifice here becomes irrelevant, because love alone is your strongest driving force. So when there is so much love there cannot be sacrifice. At the same time when there is no love, there is no sacrifice. For example, if a mother has made plans to see a movie and she realizes that her child is sick, she does not say that she has sacrificed the movie to nurse her child, because she simply did not want to go. Nothing else seems to charm the mother besides being with her child. You do not sacrifice something for someone you are in love with. Sacrifice indicates that your pleasure has more value than the cause for which you are sacrificing. When the love is lukewarm, then sacrifice assumes meaning. Yet sacrifice purifies the human mind and reins in selfish tendencies. It can also bring pride, arrogance, self-pity and sometimes even depression. You can sacrifice only that which you value. For a wise man nothing is more valuable than truth, values and the Divine, and he will never sacrifice those. God is the greatest, and if he values the greatest then how can he sacrifice God? This is the paradox of sacrifice.",

  "text": "Divinity is unmanifest, but man has an innate desire to perceive the divine in the manifest creation around him. He creates idols, breathes faith into it and requests divinity to be present in that idol for a while, so that he can worship, express his love and play with it. At the end of his worship he requests divinity to go back into his heart from where divinity manifested. This is in all puja practices. They are not actually worshipping the idols but worshipping the unmanifest divinity which has all the divine qualities. So, the idol worshippers of the East are not the same as the ones in the Middle East as described in the Bible, because they are not just worshipping different gods and different idols, they are worshipping the ONE divinity in many different forms. Paganism, Satan and animal worship, without the knowledge of the one divinity is very different from seeing the divine in every form of the manifest universe. In the eastern tradition, gods and goddesses are part of the one divinity like the different colors of white sunlight, whereas in the Greek tradition, gods and goddesses are in themselves different entities. Worshipping Satan and different entities is totally different from worshipping divinity in its various forms. Every form belongs to the divine. When you adore the form, you are adoring the divine behind the form. With this knowledge, the very act of worship, which is more an inner phenomenon, assumes a more colorful and vibrant expression, indicating that both the form and the formless are all divine.",

The general notion is that when you work under someone, you lose your freedom, you have to be answerable. So, many people opt for business, wanting to be their own boss. But, in business, you are accountable to so many people. If you cannot be accountable to even one person, how can you be accountable to many? This is the paradox. In fact, being in business binds you more than the boss! Refusing to work under someone is a sign of weakness, not strength. A strong person would not feel uncomfortable working under anyone, because he knows his strength. It is the weak and poor in spirit who do not like to work under someone else, because they are unaware of their strength. They can be neither successful in business nor in any profession. And the same is true even in the field of social service - often volunteers do not want to work under someone else. This is merely an exhibition of their weakness. With such an attitude, they achieve very little. One who is timid and weak in spirit would be uncomfortable to work even under the Wise one; but one who knows his own strength can work effectively even under a fool! Nityanand: But to work under a fool is frustrating! SriSri: When you know your strength, with skill and intelligence, you can turn every disadvantage into an advantage. A fool can bring out the best of your communication skills! (laughter) So watch out! If you feel uncomfortable working under someone, it clearly shows you need to strengthen yourself. Desiring freedom from circumstances, situations or people is no freedom at all. Knowing that nobody can take away your freedom Ö that is strength!

Those who want to be creative and adventurous transcend convenience. Those who are ambitious and have a passion for a goal do not care for convenience. To the wise their commitment is their comfort.

The wise man will only smile at them.  Ambition can never be for something you know you can achieve effortlessly. You can only be ambitious about something for which you have to put effort, which poses a challenge and of which you are not even certain you will be able to achieve or not. Moreover it takes away the joy of the moment. With the Self-knowledge nothing is challenging to you, nor you need to put any effort. Nature is ready to fulfill your intention even before they arise, giving you no chance to crave or desire.

The wise knows that even when one is giving one is under obligations, as the person has accepted what one gives. So whether you give or take you are under obligations.

Faith out of fear, greed and insecurity; and faith born out of love like the faith between the mother and the child, the Master and disciple.

  "text": "There are five types of restlessness. The first type of restlessness is due to the place you are in. When you move away from that place, the street or the house, you immediately feel better. Chanting, singing, children playing and laughing can change this atmospheric restlessness. If you chant and sing, the vibration in the place changes. The second type of restlessness is in the body. Eating the wrong food or vata aggravating food, eating at odd times, not exercising, and overworking can all cause a physical restlessness. The remedy for this is exercise, moderation in work habits and going on a vegetable or juice diet for one or two days. The third type of restlessness is mental restlessness. It is caused by ambition, strong thoughts, likes or dislikes. Knowledge alone can cure this restlessness. Seeing life from a broader perspective, knowledge about the Self and the impermanence of everything. If you achieve everything, so what? After your achievement, you will die. Knowledge of your death or life, confidence in the Self, in the Divine, can all calm down the mental restlessness. Then there is emotional restlessness. Any amount of knowledge does not help here. Only Kriya helps! All that emotional restlessness vanishes. Also the presence of the Guru, a wise person, or a saint will help to calm your emotional restlessness. The fifth type of restlessness is rare. It is the restlessness of the soul. When everything feels empty and meaningless, know you are very fortunate. That longing and restlessness is the restlessness of the soul. Do not try to get rid of it. Embrace it! Welcome it! Usually to get rid of it people do all sorts of things - they change places, jobs or partners, do this, do that. It seems to help for some time, but it does not last. This restlessness of the soul alone can bring authentic prayer in you. It brings perfection, Siddhis and miracles in life. It is so precious to get that inner most longing for the Divine.  Satsang, the presence of the enlightened one, soothes the restlessness of the soul.",

  "title": "TENDENCIES AND INFLUENCES",
  "text": "Life moves by dual (two) factors: inner tendencies and outer influences. Inner tendencies form your attitudes and behavior, while external influences makes strong impressions in your mind. Often your tendencies generate external situations. And situations around you can form tendencies within you. This is what is called Karma. Both these factors -  the tendencies from within and influences from outside, can either be beneficial or harmful. It is the awareness that filters the outer negative influences and it is the awareness that corrects and annihilates the unhealthy inner tendencies. This awareness is called Gyana. The purpose of education is to develop this awareness, so that you can be selective about your tendencies and influences. It is practically impossible to resist the external influences and the inner tendencies without raising one’s consciousness. This can be gradual or sudden. And that is how a human being has both free will and destiny. Freedom is when you have a say about your tendencies and your influences. And only awareness and impeccable devotion can bring this freedom.",

  "text": "Authenticity and skillfulness appear to be contradictory, but in fact they are complementary. Your intentions need to be authentic and your actions need to be skillful. The more authentic the intention, the more skillful the action will be. Authentic intention and skillful action make you unshakable. Skill is required only when authenticity cannot have its way. Yet skill without authenticity makes you shallow. You cannot have an authentic action and a skillful intention. If you try to be authentic in your action but manipulative in your mind, that is when mistakes happen. John: Is it possible to have a powerful intention, like greed, that is authentic? Sri Sri: If your intention is colored by greed, over-ambition, etc. then your intention is not authentic. Whenever your intentions are impure, it pricks your consciousness, so it cannot be authentic. Authentic intentions are free from negative emotions. An action that is not skillful leads to negative emotions and an intention that is not authentic harbors negative emotions. Gayatri: If our intention is authentic and yet our actions are not skillful, what should we do? Sri Sri: Carry a handkerchief (laughter). Question: What is the best skill to deal with intention? Sri Sri: Do not keep any sankalpas (intentions) to yourself. Offer them to the Divine. Actions can never be perfect but our intentions can be perfect. Actions always have room for improvement. Action means growth and movement, and that needs space. The depth in you and the freedom in you bring out all the skillfulness in you. Krishna was the most skillful because his silence was so deep.",

For a seeker, it is necessary to honor time and space so he or she can experience sacredness in his or her mind. When you honor time and space, your mind becomes alert. But for the one who has transcended the mind, either sacredness has no meaning, or all time, every place and every mood is sacred. Precious moments are few in life. Catch them and treasure them. Place, time, mood of mind are factors that influence celebration. Snatch every opportunity to celebrate, then you feel great and full. Then celebration infiltrates your mind in all moods and space, and celebration is inevitable. Celebration reminds you of the fullness of the moment. The moments you are in the company of knowledge - the Master - are the most precious moments in your life. Treasure them. Treasuring them you transcend the mind, time and space.

You correct someone’s mistake because it bothers you. But even if you correct it, this does not work. 2. You correct someone’s mistake, not because it bothers you, but for their sake so that they can grow. To correct mistakes you need authority and love. Authority and love seem to be contradictory, but in reality they are not. Authority without love is stifling and does not work. Love without authority is shallow. A friend needs to have both authority and love but they need to be in the right combination. This can happen if you are totally dispassionate and centered. When you allow room for mistakes, you can be both authoritative and sweet. That is how the Divine is, the right balance of both. Krishna and Jesus had both. People, when they are in love, exercise authority with each other. Authority and love exist in all relationships. Abhay says, \"The husband just loves and the wife has authority.\" Mikey asks, \"Is that a mistake?\" Guruji says, \"I don’t want to correct it!\" (laughter)",

Worry entangles you.  Worry puts you in a cage. When you feel, you do not worry. Feelings are like flowers, they come up, they blossom and they die. Feelings rise, they fall and then disappear. When feelings are expressed, you feel relieved. When you are angry, you express your anger and the next moment you are all right.  Or you are upset, you cry and you get over it. Feelings last for some short time and then they drop, but worry eats at you for a longer period of time, and eventually eats you up. Feelings make you spontaneous.  Children feel, so they are spontaneous. Adults put brakes on their feelings and they start worrying.  Worrying about anything obstructs action while feelings propel action.  Worrying about negative feelings is a blessing because it puts the brakes on those feelings, preventing you from acting on them.  Usually one never worries about positive feelings.  Worries are uncertain.  Worrying takes away your energy; you cannot think clearly when you worry. Offering your worries is prayer and prayer moves you in feelings. When you think you are feeling too much then you start worrying about your feelings.  Let’s not worry about it and feel our food!",

But in the Occident, having a master is considered a matter of shame and a sign of weakness, for masters are known for enslaving people.

If you are not innocent and childlike and don’t have a sense of belongingness with the whole world, then you are hungry for power.

The owning has simply shifted from objects and people to ideas and practices. But a wise one knows that he owns the sun, the moon, the stars, the air, all of space and the Divine in its entirety. When you own something big then your consciousness also expands, and when you own something small then all the small negative emotions start coming up such as anger, greed, etc. I wonder why people do not feel connected to the sun? The very existence of life depends upon the sun. Perhaps it is the lack of awareness that one refuses to acknowledge and own one’s connectedness to the macro-cosmic universe. The Rishis in ancient India, the Native Americans and the aboriginals from all over the globe have insisted that you can feel connection to the sun, moon and the directions.

Having faith and surrendering to the Divine and knowing that there is a supreme power who loves you. The supreme power is behind you and accepts you totally. The sense of security comes with the sense of belongingness. 6. Valour/courage: Invoking the lion within you and having an attitude of sacrifice will rescue you from anxiety. 7. Reminding yourself that you are committed to a greater goal will keep the anxiety away. 8. Being unpredictable for a while. Anxiety is always related to some anticipated action. Do something completely irrelevant and unpredictable. 9. Readiness to face the worst will leave you with stability in the mind. 10. Remembering a similar situation in the past when you were able to overcome your anxiety. Chanakya : If none of theses work just come and be in the presence of the Master. (laughter)",

Your bones, skin, body, environment and five elements can be measured; you can put a value to it. So, the whole world is Maya! All measures are relative understanding. Einstein's theory of relativity correlates with the Advaita (non-dual) philosophy. But what is not Maya? All that cannot be measured is not Maya. You cannot say 1 ounce of love, 2 ounces of peace, 5 kilos of happiness, Can YOU be measured? It is not possible. Your body has weight, but not YOU. Truth cannot be measured, Ananda (joy) cannot be measured, beauty cannot be measured. All these are part of Consciousness or Easwara (Divine) and are called MAYI.",

Here, memory is your best friend. The purpose of knowledge is to remind you of your true nature. In the Bhagvad Gita, Arjuna said to Krishna,  \"I got back my memory. Now I have realized and will do as you say.\" Memory is a blessing and your best friend when it comes to your true nature. Memory is a hindrance when it does not let you be free of events, pleasant or unpleasant. Pleasant events create cravings and competition in the mind and do not allow fresh experiences, whereas unpleasant events give a biased perception and create paranoia. So the memory is both a blessing and a hindrance depending on whether you remember your nature or you are stuck with events in time and space.",

Such glory does not bring fulfillment for anyone… it is shallow.  Alternately, the dispassion that is afraid of glory is weak.  True dispassion is oblivious to glory. The glory that comes with dispassion is something that is true, that is permanent and authentic.  When someone runs after glory they are shallow.  Like movie stars, politicians and religious leaders who try to hold on to their status, to their glory, they are certain to lose.  If you run after glory all you get is misery.  When you are dispassionate, glory comes to you. If you are afraid of glory, that means you are not well-founded in dispassion.  In India, the Sadhus run away from glory.  They think they will lose their dispassion and get trapped in the web of the world, the circus.  The dispassion is so blissful, they get attached to the dispassion.  (laughter) They are afraid of losing the dispassion, the centeredness and bliss that comes along with it.  This is weak dispassion.  Dispassion is a state of being and glory is the happening around it.  True dispassion can never be lost or overshadowed by glory. True dispassion is glorious! Real glory is true dispassion!",

They need to be supported materially.  There is no spirituality in the world that is devoid of service and service cannot happen if material needs are ignored.  Service cannot happen only through the lips. For service to move you need legs. Every system has its flaws.

The solution lies in understanding the paradox of love and truth. People tell lies just to save and maintain their love. The fear that the truth might damage their love causes lies to be told between husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, parents and children and in family situations. In love you feel weak and truth brings strength. Yet why do people prefer love over truth, i.e. weakness over strength?! (laughter) No one wants to sacrifice love. Thus people are ready to give up the truth for their love. Love takes the luster out of truth. Sometimes truth can make love bitter while in love even lies can appear sweet, like Krishna’s lies to his mother Yashoda! The truth that does not nourish love has no sense and the love that cannot withstand the truth is not true love. When one is assured that the love is so strong that the truth can neither break it nor cause bitterness, then the truth prevails and love shines. Truth has judgments, but true love is beyond judgments. Thus true love makes you weak and yet it is the greatest strength.",
